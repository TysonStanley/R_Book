# Chapter 10: Where to Go from Here and Common Pitfalls {-}

There are many resources that can aid in developing your `R` skills from here. We have introduced the basics of `R`, focusing on the ones that are most important for researchers in the health, social, and behavioral sciences. 

Since this has been a primer, we hope that you will continue your learning of `R` via the various sources available at little to no cost. Just like this book, many `R` books are available online as well as in print. This allows you to explore and learn online at your own pace without having to buy a bunch of books or other resources.

Below, we list a handful of `R` references that we have found to be useful:

1. R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham
2. ...


## Common Pitfalls {-}

To end, we wanted to highlight some pitfalls that can plague any beginner to `R`. We list a few that we've encountered, although others surely exist.

1. Document your work.


## Quiz {-}

As a final note, we thought we would give you a quiz to test your memory of the topics we've covered. Don't worry; no pressure to get them all. We've included some tougher ones. Regardless of how well you do, we hope you'll continue improving in your `R` programming skills.

#### Question 1 {-}

If the following code were part of your script would you:

a. scream in fear
b. be as proud as could be
c. neither; I would fix it
d. neither; it works but it isn't pretty
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- df +
  mutate(newvar = ifelse(oldvar == 1, 1, 0))
```

If it is broken, how would you fix it?

#### Question 2 {-}











Thanks!
