description: "This book introduces the R statistical language for researchers in the health, behavioral, educational, and psychological sciences. It is designed for those that have little background in statistical programming but would like to use the powerful statistical and visualization tool that R offers at no cost. The light-hearted design of this book allows a researcher to investigate and begin using R relatively stress-free with intuitive and interesting examples."

# Preface {-}

Before beginning the book, you will need to download the `R` software [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) and then the RStudio software [www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/). `R` is the brains and `RStudio`[^free] is an "IDE" (something that helps us work with `R` much more easily). 

Once both are installed (helps on installing the software can be found on [www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/), [www.r-bloggers.com](www.r-bloggers.com), and [www.statmethods.net](www.statmethods.net)) you are good to go. The remainder of the book will be about actually using it.

The book is divided into three parts.

## Part I {-}

1. Chapter 1: The Basics
2. Chapter 2: Working with and Cleaning Your Data
3. Chapter 3: Understanding Your Data (summary statistics, ggplot2)

## Part II {-}

4. Chapter 4: Basic Statistical Analyses (T-tests, ANOVA, Linear Regression)
5. Chapter 5: Generalized Linear Models
6. Chapter 6: Mulilevel Modeling
7. Chapter 7: Other Modeling Techniques

## Part III {-}

8. Chapter 8: Advanced data manipulation
9. Chapter 9: Advanced plotting
10. Chapter 10: Where to go from here

At the end of the book, you should be able to: 1) use `R` to perform your data cleaning and data analyses and 2) understand online helps (e.g. [www.stackoverflow.com](www.stackoverflow.com), [www.r-bloggers.com](www.r-bloggers.com)) so your potential in `R` becomes nearly limitless.

Enjoy![^return]


[^free]: Get the free version of `Rstudio`. Believe me, it doesn't feel like it should be free software.
