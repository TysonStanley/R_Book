A common view is that any study finding an effect under noisy conditions provides evidence that the underlying effect is particularly strong and robust. Yet, statistical significance conveys very little information when measurements are noisy. In noisy research settings, poor measurement can contribute to exaggerated estimates of effect size. This problem and related misunderstandings are key components in a feedback loop that perpetuates the replication crisis in science.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relative risk is a summary metric that is commonly used in epidemiological investigations. Increasingly, epidemiologists are using log-binomial models to study the impact of a set of predictor variables on a single binary outcome, as they naturally offer relative risks. However, standard statistical software may report failed convergence when attempting to fit log-binomial models in certain settings. The methods that have been proposed in the literature for dealing with failed convergence use approximate solutions to avoid the issue. This research looks directly at the log-likelihood function for the simplest log-binomial model where failed convergence has been observed, a model with a single linear predictor with three levels. The possible causes of failed convergence are explored and potential solutions are presented for some cases. RESULTS: Among the principal causes is a failure of the fitting algorithm to converge despite the log-likelihood function having a single finite maximum. Despite these limitations, log-binomial models are a viable option for epidemiologists wishing to describe the relationship between a set of predictors and a binary outcome where relative risk is the desired summary measure. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologists are encouraged to continue to use log-binomial models and advocate for improvements to the fitting algorithms to promote the widespread use of log-binomial models.},

abstract = {Many diseases commonly associated with aging are now thought to have social and physiologic antecedents in early life. Understanding how the timing of exposure to early life risk factors influences later-life health may illuminate mechanisms driving adult health inequalities and identify possible points for effective interventions. Recognizing chronic diseases as developing across the lifecourse also has implications for the conduct of research on adult risk factors for disease. We review alternative conceptual models that describe how the timing of risk factor exposure relates to the development of disease. We propose some expansions of lifecourse models to improve their relevance for research on adult chronic disease, using the relationship between education and adult cognitive decline and dementia as an example. We discuss the important implications each of the lifecourse conceptual models has on study design, analysis, and interpretation of research on aging and chronic diseases. We summarize several research considerations implied by the lifecourse framework, including: advantages of analyzing change in function rather than onset of impairment; the pervasive challenge of survivor bias; the importance of controlling for possible confounding by early life conditions; and the likely heterogeneity in responses of adults to treatment.},

First, we explore the meaning of the terms ?method? and ?method bias? and then we examine whether method biases influence all measures equally.

abstract = {This paper summarizes some of the literature on causal effects in mediation analysis. It presents causally-defined direct and indirect effects for continuous, binary, ordinal, nominal, and count variables. The expansion to non-continuous mediators and outcomes offers a broader array of causal mediation analyses than previously considered in structural equation modeling practice. A new result is the ability to handle mediation by a nominal variable. Examples with a binary outcome and a binary, ordinal or nominal mediator are given using Mplus to compute the effects. The causal effects require strong assumptions even in randomized designs, especially sequential ignorability, which is presumably often violated to some extent due to mediator-outcome confounding. To study the effects of violating this assumption, it is shown how a sensitivity analysis can be carried out. This can be used both in planning a new study and in evaluating the results of an existing study.},

The program is important because it can be used to obtain more accurate confidence limits for the indirect effect, as demonstrated in several recent articles (MacKinnon, Lockwood, {\&} Williams, 2004; Pituch, Whittaker, {\&} Stapleton, 2005). Tests of the significance of and confidence limits for indirect effects based on the distribution of the product method have more accurate Type I error rates and more power than other, more commonly used tests. Values for the two paths involved in the indirect effect and their standard errors are entered in the PRODCLIN program, and distribution of the product confidence limits are computed. Several examples are used to illustrate the PRODCLIN program. The PRODCLIN programs in rich text format may be downloaded from www.psychonomic.org/archive.},

In particular, two types of measurement models for method effects can be distinguished. First, models with a general factor, in which method effects are defined as deviations from a common trait, and second, models for contrasting methods, in which method effects are defined relative to another method but not to a general trait. We argue that the first type of models require a two-level research design (interchangeable methods) whereas the second type of models can be applied to a one-level research design (structurally different methods). Current directions in the uses of these approaches for longitudinal research and multiple-rater studies are described. Keywords},

Although carefully studied by Dempster and Schatzoff, the stochastic aspect of p values is often neglected. In this expository note we borrow from Demp-ster and Schatzoff to rekindle interest in-and explore the potential usefulness of-understanding the stochastic be-havior of p values. We relate the expected p value (EPV) under the alternative to the more familiar concepts of sig-nificance level and power. We then go on to argue that in cases where it is difficult to evaluate the power function, the EPV can be used as a measure of the performance of a test. EPV's are always easily evaluated or simulated. Different test statistics for the same hypotheses can also be com-pared by means of EPV's. We carry out such a comparison between the two-sample, one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, and t tests, for a variety of underlying dis-tributions. The EPV can also be a valuable tool in sample size determination and in the interpretation of observed p values. We hope to convince practitioners of the usefulness of EPV's.},

abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

In the end, a solution is recommended that is both optimal in its statistical qualities as well as practical and easily implemented: compute z Mediation. ?? 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology.},

abstract = {Statistical mediation analysis allows researchers to identify the most important med- iating constructs in the causal process studied. Identifying specific mediators is espe- cially relevant when the hypothesized mediating construct consists of multiple related facets. The general definition of the construct and its facets might relate differently to an outcome. However, current methods do not allow researchers to study the rela- tionships between general and specific aspects of a construct to an outcome simulta- neously. This study proposes a bifactor measurement model for the mediatingconstruct as a way to parse variance and represent the general aspect and specific facets of a construct simultaneously. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented to help determine the properties of mediated effect estimation when the mediator has a bifactor structure and a specific facet of a construct is the true mediator. This study also investigates the conditions when researchers can detect the mediated effect when the multidimensionality of the mediator is ignored and treated as unidimen- sional. Simulation results indicated that the mediation model with a bifactor mediator measurement model had unbiased and adequate power to detect the mediated effect with a sample size greater than 500 and medium a- and b-paths. Also, results indicate that parameter bias and detection of the mediated effect in both the data-generating model and the misspecified model varies as a function of the amount of facet variance represented in the mediation model. This study contributes to the largely unexplored area of measurement issues in statistical mediation analysis. Keywords},

abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

In contrast to other statistical estimates, however, their sample-to-sample variability is usually not considered or estimated, and therefore not fully appreciated. Via a systematic study of log-scale p-value standard errors, bootstrap prediction bounds, and reproducibility probabilities for future replicate p-values, we show that p-values exhibit surprisingly large variability in typical data situations. In addition to providing context to discussions about the failure of statistical results to replicate, our findings shed light on the relative value of exact p-values vis-a-vis approximate p-values, and indicate that the use of *, **, and *** to denote levels 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 of statistical significance in subject-matter journals is about the right level of precision for reporting p-values when judged by widely accepted rules for rounding statistical estimates.},

abstract = {In this commentary, structural equation models (SEMs) are discussed as a tool for epidemiologic analysis. Such models are related to and compared with other analytic approaches often used in epidemiology, including regression analysis, causal diagrams, causal mediation analysis, and marginal structural models. Several of these other approaches in fact developed out of the SEM literature. However, SEMs themselves tend to make much stronger assumptions than these other techniques. SEMs estimate more types of effects than do these other techniques, but this comes at the price of additional assumptions. Many of these assumptions have often been ignored and not carefully evaluated when SEMs have been used in practice. In light of the strong assumptions employed by SEMs, the author argues that they should be used principally for the purposes of exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation when a broad range of effects are potentially of interest.},

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

abstract = {A recent study of the replicability of key psychological findings is a major contribution toward understanding the human side of the scientific process. Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36{\%} of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77{\%} of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95{\%} prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers' intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

abstract = {Aim: Although unplanned admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) are associated with poorer prognoses, there is no published prognostic tool available for predicting this risk in an individual patient. We developed a nomogram for calculating the individualised absolute risk of unplanned ICU admission during a hospital stay. Method: Hospital administrative data from a large district hospital of consecutive admissions from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 of aged over 14 years was used. Patient data was extracted from 94,482 hospital admissions consisted of demographic and clinical variables, including diagnostic categories, types of admission and time and day of admission. Multivariate logistic regression coefficients were used to develop a predictive nomogram of individual risk to patients admitted to the study hospital of unplanned ICU admission. Results: A total of 672 incident unplanned ICU admissions were identified over this period. Independent predictors of unplanned ICU admissions included being male, older age, emergency department (ED) admissions, after-hour admissions, weekend admissions and six principal diagnosis groups: fractured femur, acute pancreatitis, liver disease, chronic airway disease, pneumonia and heart failure. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.81. Conclusion: The use of a nomogram to accurately identify at-risk patients using information that is readily available to clinicians has the potential to be a useful tool in reducing unplanned ICU admissions, which in turn may contribute to the reduction of adverse events of patients in the general wards. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Stigma and discrimination related to sexual minority status are unique stressors associated with mental and physical health concerns among sexual minority individuals. Although some theoretical models propose that the strategies sexual minorities apply to cope with these particular stressors can mediate and/or moderate their impact on mental health outcomes, only a few studies have examined this proposition empirically, typically using measures of broad coping strategies that are not discrimination- specific. A nonprobability sample of 354 self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals completed self-report measures of perceived discrimination experiences, psychological distress, and discrimination-specific coping strategies used, including education/advocacy, internalization, drug and alcohol use, resistance, and detachment strategies. Perceived discrimination explained levels of depres- sion, anxiety, and stress after controlling for income, education, and race. Drug and alcohol use mediated the relationship between discrimination and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Internalization mediated the relationship between discrimination and anxiety symptoms and moderated the relationship between discrimination and depression and anxiety. The education/advocacy, resistance, and detachment strategies played no clear mediator or moderator roles in the relationship between discrimination and psychological distress. Psychological interventions that assist sexual minority clients in the development of effective coping skills, such as avoidance of drug and alcohol use for coping and internalization may reduce the harm associated with the experience of stigma and discrimination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) ward admissions subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 24 hours have higher mortality than direct ICU admissions. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: Describe risk factors for unplanned ICU transfer within 24 hours of ward arrival from the ED. METHODS: Evaluation of 178,315 ED non-ICU admissions to 13 US community hospitals. We tabulated the outcome of unplanned ICU transfer by patient characteristics and hospital volume. We present factors associated with unplanned ICU transfer after adjusting for patient and hospital differences in a hierarchical logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 4,252 (2.4{\%}) non-ICU admissions transferred to the ICU within 24 hours. Admitting diagnoses most associated with unplanned transfer, listed by descending prevalence were: pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.9), myocardial infarction (MI) (OR 1.5; 95{\%} CI 1.2-2.0), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR 1.4; 95{\%} CI 1.1-1.9), sepsis (OR 2.5; 95{\%} CI 1.9-3.3), and catastrophic conditions (OR 2.3; 95{\%} CI 1.7-3.0). Other significant predictors included: male sex, Comorbidity Points Score {\textgreater}145, Laboratory Acute Physiology Score ≥7, arriving on the ward between 11 PM and 7 AM. Decreased risk was found with admission to monitored transitional care units (OR 0.83; 95{\%} CI 0.77-0.90) and to higher volume hospitals (OR 0.94 per 1,000 additional annual ED inpatient admissions; 95{\%} CI 0.91-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: ED patients admitted with respiratory conditions, MI, or sepsis are at modestly increased risk for unplanned ICU transfer and may benefit from better triage from the ED, earlier intervention, or closer monitoring to prevent acute decompensation. More research is needed to determine how intermediate care units, hospital volume, time of day, and sex affect unplanned ICU transfer.

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present nationally representative estimates of health-related limitations, needs, and service use among US children with and without developmental disabilities (DDs). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data from a sample of US households from the 1997-2005 National Health Interview Surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3 to 17 years (n = 95 132). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parents or other knowledgeable adults reported on their children's DDs, health needs, and use of health and education services. Developmental disabilities included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, blindness, cerebral palsy, deaf/a lot of trouble hearing, learning disability, mental retardation, seizures, stuttering/stammering, and other developmental delay. RESULTS: Among children with 1 or more DDs, prevalence estimates for limitations in movement (6.1{\%}), needed help with personal care (3.2{\%}), needed special equipment (3.5{\%}), received home health care (1.4{\%}), and regularly took prescription medication(s) (37.5{\%}) were 4 to 32 times higher than for children without DDs. Children with DDs were 2 to 8 times as likely to have had more than 9 health care visits (14.9{\%}), received special education (38.8{\%}), had a surgical or medical procedure (7.5{\%}), and recently visited a medical specialist (23.9{\%}), mental health professional (26.6{\%}), therapist/allied health professional (19.6{\%}), and/or emergency department (10.3{\%}). Effects were generally stable during the study interval and independent of age, race, sex, and family income. Cerebral palsy, autism, mental retardation, blindness, and deafness/a lot of trouble hearing were associated with the highest levels of health and functional impact indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Developmental disabilities profoundly affect children's health and functioning. These data can inform evidence-based targeted prevention strategies for minimizing functional limitations and lifetime disability. Additional study of unmet needs and access to care is needed.},

In this paper we illustrate the use of generalised linear models for regression analysis of cost data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We consider generalised linear models with either an identity link function (providing additive covariate effects) or log link function (providing multiplicative effects), and with gaussian (normal), overdispersed poisson, gamma, or inverse gaussian distributions. These are applied to estimate the treatment effects in two randomised trials adjusted for baseline covariates. Criteria for choosing an appropriate model are presented.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In both examples considered, the gaussian model fits poorly and other distributions are to be preferred. When there are variables of prognostic importance in the model, using different distributions can materially affect the estimates obtained; it may also be possible to discriminate between additive and multiplicative covariate effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Generalised linear models are attractive for the regression of cost data because they provide parametric methods of analysis where a variety of non-normal distributions can be specified and the way covariates act can be altered. Unlike the use of data transformation in ordinary least-squares regression, generalised linear models make inferences about the mean cost directly.},

Researchers estimating such models often give little attention to the coefficient estimates and instead focus on marginal effects, predicted probabilities, predicted counts, etc. Since the models are nonlinear, the estimated effects are sensitive to how one generates the predictions. The most common approach involves estimating the effect for the “average case.” But this approach creates a weaker connection between the results and the larger goals of the research enterprise and is thus less preferable than the observed-value approach. That is, rather than seeking to understand the effect for the average case, the goal is to obtain an estimate of the average effect in the population. In addition to the theoretical argument in favor of the observed-value approach, we illustrate via an empirical example and Monte Carlo simulations that the two approaches can produce substantively different results.},

abstract = {Context Hearing loss is common and, in young persons, can compromise social development, communication skills, and educational achievement. Objective To examine the current prevalence of hearing loss in US adolescents and determine whether it has changed over time. Design Cross-sectional analyses of US representative demographic and audiometric data from the 1988 through 1994 and 2005 through 2006 time periods. Setting The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988-1994, and NHANES 2005-2006. Participants NHANES III examined 2928 participants and NHANES 2005-2006 examined 1771 participants, aged 12 to 19 years. Main Outcome Measures We calculated the prevalence of hearing loss in participants aged 12 to 19 years after accounting for the complex survey design. Audiometrically determined hearing loss was categorized as either unilateral or bilateral for low frequency (0.5, 1, and 2 kHz) or high frequency (3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz), and as slight loss ({\textgreater}15 to {\textless}25 dB) or mild or greater loss (≥25 dB) according to hearing sensitivity in the worse ear. The prevalence of hearing loss from NHANES 2005-2006 was compared with the prevalence from NHANES III (1988-1994). We also examined the cross-sectional relations between several potential risk factors and hearing loss. Logistic regression was used to calculate multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). Results The prevalence of any hearing loss increased significantly from 14.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 13.0{\%}-16.9{\%}) in 1988-1994 to 19.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 15.2{\%}-23.8{\%}) in 2005-2006 (P = .02). In 2005-2006, hearing loss was more commonly unilateral (prevalence, 14.0{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 10.4{\%}-17.6{\%}, vs 11.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 9.5{\%}-12.8{\%} in 1988-1994; P = .005) and involved the high frequencies (prevalence, 16.4{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 13.2{\%}-19.7{\%}, vs 12.8{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 11.1{\%}-14.5{\%} in 1988-1994; P = .02). Individuals from families below the federal poverty threshold (prevalence, 23.6{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 18.5{\%}-28.7{\%}) had significantly higher odds of hearing loss (multivariate adjusted OR, 1.60; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-2.32) than those above the threshold (prevalence, 18.4{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 13.6{\%}-23.2{\%}). Conclusion The prevalence of hearing loss among a sample of US adolescents aged 12 to 19 years was greater in 2005-2006 compared with 1988-1994.},

Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

abstract = {Purpose: Advances in research have broadened our understanding of the risky behaviors that significantly threaten adolescent health and well-being. Advances include: using person-centered, rather than behavior-centered approaches to examine how behaviors co-occur; greater focus on how environmental factors, such as family, or peer-level characteristics, influence behavior; and examination of how behaviors affect well-being in young adulthood. Use of nationally representative, longitudinal data would expand research on these critical relationships. Methods: Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort, a nationally representative sample of adolescents who are being followed over time, the present study: (1) identifies profiles of risky behaviors, (2) investigates how environmental characteristics predict these profiles of risky behaviors (e.g., delinquency, smoking, drug use, drinking, sexual behavior, and exercise), and (3) examines how these profiles of risky behaviors relate to positive and negative youth outcomes. Results: Four "risk profiles" were identified: a high-risk group (those who report high levels of participation in numerous behaviors), a low-risk group (those who engage in very few risky behaviors), and two moderate risk-taking groups. We found that profiles with any negative behaviors were predictive of negative outcomes. Conclusions: It is important for practitioners to examine health behaviors in multiple domains concurrently rather than individually in isolation. Interventions and research should not simply target adolescents engaging in high levels of risky behavior but also adolescents who are engaging in lower levels of risky behavior. ?? 2009 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is “reproducibility,” which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

The editors issued an open call for submissions of manuscripts that contained no mention of their actual results, incentivizing reviewers to evaluate manuscripts based on their theoretical contributions, research designs, and analysis plans. The three papers in this special issue are the result of this process that began with 19 submissions. In this article, we describe the rationale for this pilot, expressly articulating the practices of preregistration and results-free review. We document the process of carrying out the special issue with a discussion of the three accepted papers, and critically evaluate the role of both preregistration and results-free review. Our main conclusions are that results-free review encourages much greater attention to theory and research design, but that it raises thorny problems about how to anticipate and interpret null findings. We also observe that as currently practiced, results-free review has a particular affinity with experimental and cross-case methodologies. Our lack of submissions from scholars using qualitative or interpretivist research suggests limitations to the widespread use of results-free review.},

@article{Dreber2015,
abstract = {Concerns about a lack of reproducibility of statistically significant results have recently been raised in many fields, and it has been argued that this lack comes at substantial economic costs. We here report the results from prediction markets set up to quantify the reproducibility of 44 studies published in prominent psychology journals and replicated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The prediction markets predict the outcomes of the replications well and outperform a survey of market participants' individual forecasts. This shows that prediction markets are a promising tool for assessing the reproducibility of published scientific results. The prediction markets also allow us to estimate probabilities for the hypotheses being true at different testing stages, which provides valuable information regarding the temporal dynamics of scientific discovery. We find that the hypotheses being tested in psychology typically have low prior probabilities of being true (median, 9{\%}) and that a "statistically significant" finding needs to be confirmed in a well-powered replication to have a high probability of being true. We argue that prediction markets could be used to obtain speedy information about reproducibility at low cost and could potentially even be used to determine which studies to replicate to optimally allocate limited resources into replications.},

abstract = {We revisit the results of the recent Reproducibility Project: Psychology by the Open Science Collaboration. We compute Bayes factors—a quantity that can be used to express comparative evidence for an hypothesis but also for the null hypothesis—for a large subset (N = 72) of the original papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the originally published results. Overall, 75{\%} of studies gave qualitatively similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor {\textless} 10). The majority of the studies (64{\%}) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the original paper provided strong evidence but the replication did not (15{\%}), the sample size in the replication was smaller than the original. Where the replication provided strong evidence but the original did not (10{\%}), the replication sample size was larger. We conclude that the apparent failure of the Reproducibility Project to replicate many target effects can be adequately explained by overestimation of effect sizes (or overestimation of evidence against the null hypothesis) due to small sample sizes and publication bias in the psychological literature. We further conclude that traditional sample sizes are insufficient and that a more widespread adoption of Bayesian methods is desirable.},

Most of the current discussion and approbation is centered on direct or exact replications, the attempt to conduct a study in a manner as close to the original as possible. We focus on the value of conceptual replications, the attempt to test the same theoretical process as an existing study, but that uses methods that vary in some way from the previous study. The tension between the two kinds of replication is a tension of values???exact replications value confidence in operationalizations; their requirement tends to favor the status quo. Conceptual replications value confidence in theory; their use tends to favor rapid progress over ferreting out error. We describe the many ways in which conceptual replications can be superior to direct replications. We further argue that the social system of science is quite robust to these threats and is self-correcting.},

We show by means of simulations that even with minimal omitted-variable bias (e.g., unaccounted confounding) p-curves based on true effects and p-curves based on null-effects with p-hacking cannot be reliably distinguished. We also demonstrate this problem using as practical example the evaluation of the effect of malaria prevalence on economic growth between 1960 and 1996. These findings call recent studies into question that use the p-curve to infer that most published research findings are based on true effects in the medical literature and in a wide range of disciplines. p-values in observational research may need to be empirically calibrated to be interpretable with respect to the commonly used significance threshold of 0.05.

Administrative data reveal that among those at highest risk are soldiers in the 12 months after inpatient treatment of a psychiatric disorder.Objective To develop an actuarial risk algorithm predicting suicide in the 12 months after US Army soldier inpatient treatment of a psychiatric disorder to target expanded posthospitalization care.Design, Setting, and Participants There were 53 769 hospitalizations of active duty soldiers from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification psychiatric admission diagnoses. Administrative data available before hospital discharge abstracted from a wide range of data systems (sociodemographic, US Army career, criminal justice, and medical or pharmacy) were used to predict suicides in the subsequent 12 months using machine learning methods (regression trees and penalized regressions) designed to evaluate cross-validated linear, nonlinear, and interactive predictive associations.Main Outcomes and Measures Suicides of soldiers hospitalized with psychiatric disorders in the 12 months after hospital discharge.Results Sixty-eight soldiers died by suicide within 12 months of hospital discharge (12.0{\%} of all US Army suicides), equivalent to 263.9 suicides per 100 000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100 000 person-years in the total US Army.

A total of 52.9{\%} of posthospitalization suicides occurred after the 5{\%} of hospitalizations with highest predicted suicide risk (3824.1 suicides per 100 000 person-years). These highest-risk hospitalizations also accounted for significantly elevated proportions of several other adverse posthospitalization outcomes (unintentional injury deaths, suicide attempts, and subsequent hospitalizations).Conclusions and Relevance The high concentration of risk of suicide and other adverse outcomes might justify targeting expanded posthospitalization interventions to soldiers classified as having highest posthospitalization suicide risk, although final determination requires careful consideration of intervention costs, comparative effectiveness, and possible adverse effects.},

abstract = {In the sparse linear regression setting, we consider testing the significance of the predictor variable that enters the current lasso model, in the sequence of models visited along the lasso solution path. We propose a simple test statistic based on lasso fitted values, called the covariance test statistic, and show that when the true model is linear, this statistic has an {\$}\backslashoperatorname {\{}Exp{\}}(1){\$} asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis (the null being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso model). Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to enter the model (i.e., testing for a single significant predictor variable against the global null) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix {\$}X{\$}. On the other hand, our proof for a general step in the lasso path places further technical assumptions on {\$}X{\$} and the generative model, but still allows for the important high-dimensional case {\$}p{\textgreater}n{\$}, and does not necessarily require that the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active variables. Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable between two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test, comparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\_}1{\$} distribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been chosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity makes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\_}1{\$} under the null hypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since the lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter {\$}\backslashlambda{\$} decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though additional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active variables are shrunken due to the {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$} penalty. Therefore, the test statistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by these two opposing properties - adaptivity and shrinkage - and its null distribution is tractable and asymptotically {\$}\backslashoperatorname {\{}Exp{\}}(1){\$}.},

Mixture modeling is a widely applied data analysis technique used to identify unobserved heterogeneity in a population. Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion (ICs) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis (LCA), a factor mixture model (FMA), and a growth mixture models (GMM). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the ICs, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.

abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In genome-based prediction there is considerable uncertainty about the statistical model and method required to maximize prediction accuracy. For traits influenced by a small number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), predictions are expected to benefit from methods performing variable selection [e.g., BayesB or the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)] compared to methods distributing effects across the genome [ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP)]. We investigate the assumptions underlying successful variable selection by combining computer simulations with large-scale experimental data sets from rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). We demonstrate that variable selection can be successful when the number of phenotyped individuals is much larger than the number of causal mutations contributing to the trait. We show that the sample size required for efficient variable selection increases dramatically with decreasing trait heritabilities and increasing extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We contrast and discuss contradictory results from simulation and experimental studies with respect to superiority of variable selection methods over RR-BLUP. Our results demonstrate that due to long-range LD, medium heritabilities, and small sample sizes, superiority of variable selection methods cannot be expected in plant breeding populations even for traits like FRIGIDA gene expression in Arabidopsis and flowering time in rice, assumed to be influenced by a few major QTL. We extend our conclusions to the analysis of whole-genome sequence data and infer upper bounds for the number of causal mutations which can be identified by LASSO. Our results have major impact on the choice of statistical method needed to make credible inferences about genetic architecture and prediction accuracy of complex traits.},

abstract = {In randomized trials, researchers are often interested in mediation analysis to understand how a treatment works, in particular how much of a treatment's effect is mediated by an intermediated variable and how much the treatment directly affects the outcome not through the mediator. The standard regression approach to mediation analysis assumes sequential ignorability of the mediator, that is that the mediator is effectively randomly assigned given baseline covariates and the randomized treatment. Since the experiment does not random- ize the mediator, sequential ignorability is often not plausible. Ten Have et al. (2007, Biometrics), Dunn and Bentall (2007, Statistics in Medicine) and Albert (2008, Statistics in Medicine) presented methods that use baseline covariates interacted with randomassignment as instrumental variables, and do not require sequential ignorability. We make two contri- butions to this approach. First, in previous work on the instrumental variable approach, it has been assumed that the direct effect of treatment and the effect of the mediator are constant across subjects; we allow for variation in effects across subjects and show what assumptions are needed to obtain consistent estimates for this setting. Second, we develop a method of sensitivity analysis for violations of the key assumption that the direct effect of the treatment and the effect of the mediator do not depend on the baseline covariates.},

abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

All rights reserved.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate parent learning and support needs related to hearing aid management for young children, and factors that influence parent-reported hours of hearing aid use. Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect survey data in seven states. The child's primary caregiver completed a demographic form, a questionnaire to explore parent learning and support needs as well as their challenges with hearing aid use, and the patient health questionnaire to identify symptoms of depression. Three hundred and eighteen parents completed the questionnaires. Results: Responses were analyzed for 318 parents of children (M = 23.15 months; SD = 10.43; range: 3 to 51) who had been wearing hearing aids (M = 15.52; SD = 10.11; range: {\textless}1 to 50 months). Even though the majority of parents reported receiving the educational support queried, approximately one-third wanted more information on a variety of topics such as loaner hearing aids, what their child can/cannot hear, financial assistance, how to meet other parents, how to do basic hearing aid maintenance, and how to keep the hearing aids on their child. The most frequently reported challenges that interfered with hearing aid use (rated often or always) were child activities, child not wanting to wear the hearing aids, and fear of losing or damaging the hearing aids. Forty-two percent of parents reported that, on good days, their child used hearing aids all waking hours. Multiple regression was used to compare the effect on parent-reported typical hours of hearing aid use based on good days for the variables of (1) presence of depressive symptoms for the parent, (2) child age, (3) family income, (4) primary caregiver education level, (5) presence of additional disabilities for the child, (6) degree of hearing loss, and (7) length of time since the child was fitted with hearing aids. There were statistically significantly fewer hours of reported hearing aid use when parents reported mild to severe symptoms of depression, lower income, less education level, and when children had mild hearing loss or additional disabilities. Conclusion: Although parents reported overall that their needs for hearing aid education and support had generally been met, there were important suggestions for how audiologists and other service providers could better meet parent needs. Hearing aid use for young children was variable and influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding parent experiences and challenges can help audiologists more effectively focus support. Audiologists are more likely to meet the needs of families if they take care to provide access to thorough and comprehensive education and ongoing support that is tailored to address the unique needs of individual families.},

Indeed, it seems that coordinate-wise algorithms are not often used in convex optimization. We show that this algorithm is very competitive with the well-known LARS (or homotopy) procedure in large lasso problems, and that it can be applied to related methods such as the garotte and elastic net. It turns out that coordinate-wise descent does not work in the “fused lasso,” however, so we derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a standard convex optimizer. Finally, we generalize the procedure to the two-dimensional fused lasso, and demonstrate its performance on some image smoothing problems.},

abstract = {The R statistical environment and language has demonstrated particular strengths for interactive development of statistical algorithms, as well as data modelling and visualisation. Its current implementation has an interpreter at its core which may result in a performance penalty in comparison to directly executing user algorithms in the native machine code of the host CPU. In contrast, the C++ language has no built-in visualisation capabilities, handling of linear algebra or even basic statistical algorithms; however, user programs are converted to high-performance machine code, ahead of execution. A new method avoids possible speed penalties in R by using the Rcpp extension package in conjunction with the Armadillo C++ matrix library. In addition to the inherent performance advantages of compiled code, Armadillo provides an easy-to-use template-based meta-programming framework, allowing the automatic pooling of several linear algebra operations into one, which in turn can lead to further speedups. With the aid of Rcpp and Armadillo, conversion of linear algebra centred algorithms from R to C++ becomes straightforward. The algorithms retain the overall structure as well as readability, all while maintaining a bidirectional link with the host R environment. Empirical timing comparisons of R and C++ implementations of a Kalman filtering algorithm indicate a speedup of several orders of magnitude. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We add a set of convex constraints to the Lasso to produce sparse interaction models that honor the hierarchy restriction that an interaction only be included in a model if one or both variables are marginally important. We give a precise characterization of the effect of this hierarchy constraint, prove that hierarchy holds with probability one, and derive an unbiased estimate for the degrees of freedom of our estimator. A bound on this estimate reveals the amount of fitting "saved" by the hierarchy constraint. We distinguish between parameter sparsity -- the number of nonzero coefficients -- and practical sparsity -- the number of raw variables one must measure to make a new prediction. Hierarchy focuses on the latter, which is more closely tied to important data collection concerns such as cost, time, and effort. We develop an algorithm, available in the R package hierNet, and perform an empirical study of our method.},

abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample inwhich treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitativemethods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions.The qualitativemethods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice' when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.},

This addresses the following challenge: Having mined a set of data to find potential associations, how do we properly assess the strength of these associations? The fact that we have "cherry-picked"--searched for the strongest associations--means that we must set a higher bar for declaring significant the associations that we see. This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling. The cherry tree (dataset) can be very large and the tools for cherry picking (statistical learning methods) are now very sophisticated.

abstract = {Objective: This article reports the integration and outcomes of implementing intervention services for substance use disorder (SUD) in three New York City public sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. Methods: The screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) service model was implemented in the STD clinics in 2008. A relational database was developed, which included screening results, service dispositions, face-to-face interviews with 6-month follow-ups, and treatment information. Results: From February 2008 to the end of September 2012, 146 657 STD clinic patients 18 years or older were screened for current or past substance use disorders; 15 687 received a brief intervention; 954 received referrals to formal substance abuse treatment; 2082 were referred to substance abuse support services such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and 690 were referred to mental health, social or HIV awareness services. Intervention services delivered through SBIRT resulted in improvements in multiple outcomes at 6 month follow-up. Patients who received interventions had reduced SUD risks, fewer mental health problems, and fewer unprotected sexual contacts. Conclusion: Delivery of SUD services in a public health setting represents a significant policy and practice change and benefits many individuals whose SUDs might otherwise be overlooked. Intervention services for substance use disorder were integrated and highly utilized in the STD setting. Further research needs to focus on the long-term impact of SUD interventions in the STD setting, their cost effectiveness, and the extent they are financially sustainable under the new healthcare law.},

abstract = {Background: Although some studies examined the moderating role of gender in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and mental disorders later in life, a number of them examined the effects of only one or two types of maltreatment on an individual mental disorder, for instance, depression, substance use. It is of considerable clinical and theoretical importance to have in-depth understanding what roles of different types of childhood abuse play out in a wide range of mental disorders among women and men using well accepted instruments measuring abuse and mental disorders. The present study aimed to examine this issue using a large nationally representative population sample to explore the gender effect of different types of childhood abuse in mental disorders, and assess the moderating role of gender in the abuse-mental disorder relationship. Methods: Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2012: Mental Health we sought to answer this question. Respondents with information on childhood maltreatment prior to age 16 were selected (N = 23, 395). Results: We found: i) strong associations between childhood abuse frequency and gender; ii) significant differences between men and women in terms of mental disorders; iii) strong associations between childhood abuse and mental disorders; and, iv) gender moderated the role of childhood abuse history on adulthood mental disorders. Females with a history of sexual abuse and/or exposure to interpersonal violence were at a greater risk of alcohol abuse or dependence later in life. Conclusions: Intervention should occur as early as possible, and should help female victims of childhood sexual abuse and/or exposure to interpersonal violence, and their families to build more constructive ways to effectively reduce the negative affects of these experiences. Recognition of the moderating role of gender on the relationship between childhood abuse history and mental disorders later in life may aid clinicians and researchers in providing optimal health services.},

abstract = {Purpose: Recently we found that the early onset of regular tobacco use is as predictive of lifetime drug use and depressive disorders as it is of alcohol use disorders [Alcohol.: Clin. Exp. Res. 23 (1999) 513.]. This finding, which paralleled findings regarding early onset of alcohol use [J. Subst. Abuse 10 (1998) 59.], suggested that early regular use of any drug might simply be an indicator of risk for a constellation of problem behaviors. The purpose of the present study is to test this hypothesis as well as to study the strength and patterns of associations among these problem behaviors already present among youth. The results will permit description of more precise profiles to identify groups of children at risk. Methods: Using data for respondents aged 12–16 from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regression models were estimated. Results: Descriptive analyses indicated that in comparison with those who never smoked, or who simply experimented, early-onset regular smokers, both those who began at age 13 or younger and those who did so between 14 and 16, were those most likely to use alcohol and other drugs as well as have school problems and early sexual experiences culminating in pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations among these high-risk behaviors. Implications: These results support the hypothesis that early onset of smoking is but an indicator of a syndrome of problem behaviors already in place during childhood. They also suggest that the significance of an age onset variable may differ depending on the age of the sample used. As follow-up data are collected, we expect to learn much about the natural course of the distinct risk groups identified in the analyses by studying longitudinally this nationally representative group of early adolescents.},

abstract = {The stressor vulnerability model of alcohol use posits that individuals learn to use drinking as a coping response when they believe healthier means of coping are unavailable. The present study evaluated hypotheses derived from the model adding two potential coping resources that may be important for adolescents - perceived family support and expectancies for negative mood regulation. Students in Grades 9-12 (N=210, 50{\%} female) completed self-report measures of family environment, alcohol expectancies, coping preferences, negative mood regulation, motives for drinking, and drinking behavior. Recent drinking, lifetime drinking, and drunkenness were positively associated with stronger tension reduction alcohol expectancies, and drinking to cope (DTC) completely mediated these relations. DTC also was associated with avoidant coping dispositions and with the interaction between tension reduction alcohol expectancies and avoidant coping dispositions. Family support and NMR expectancies were only modestly correlated with DTC and not correlated with drinking measures. In regression analyses, family support and NMR expectancies were not associated with DTC independent of tension reduction expectancies and avoidant coping disposition. However, these two coping resource variables moderated the relations of other predictors with DTC and with drunkenness. The present study supports the stressor vulnerability model and highlights the importance of family support and NMR expectancies as coping resources related to drinking processes. Because many of the tenets of the model appear to extend to adolescents, it may have considerable utility as a conceptual framework for the design and implementation of prevention programs. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The analyses employed multiple indicator multiple cause and structural equation models. Adolescent substance use was measured by frequencies of alcohol use, being drunk, and cigarette and marijuana use in the past month. Peer influence had a direct influence on adolescent substance use. Maternal knowledge had both direct and indirect influences on adolescent substance use through its negative association with substance-using peers, whereas paternal knowledge only had an indirect influence. Parental knowledge and peer substance use totally mediated differences in adolescent substance use by grade; differences between Caucasian and African-American or Hispanic adolescents; and differences between adolescents from two-parent families and those from single-mother, single-father or mother-stepfather families. Parental knowledge and peer substance were important mediators which largely accounted for variability in the prevalence of adolescent substance use by grade, race/ethnicity, and family structure.},

A series of population-based and epidemiological studies have identified specific stressors and individual-level variables that are predictive of substance use and abuse. Preclinical research also shows that stress exposure enhances drug self-administration and reinstates drug seeking in drug-experienced animals. The deleterious effects of early life stress, child maltreatment, and accumulated adversity on alterations in the corticotropin releasing factor and hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis (CRF/HPA), the extrahypothalamic CRF, the autonomic arousal, and the central noradrenergic systems are also presented. The effects of these alterations on the corticostriatal-limbic motivational, learning, and adaptation systems that include mesolimbic dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) pathways are discussed as the underlying pathophysiology associated with stress-related risk of addiction. The effects of regular and chronic drug use on alterations in these stress and motivational systems are also reviewed, with specific attention to the impact of these adaptations on stress regulation, impulse control, and perpetuation of compulsive drug seeking and relapse susceptibility. Finally, research gaps in furthering our understanding of the association between stress and addiction are presented, with the hope that addressing these unanswered questions will significantly influence new prevention and treatment strategies to address vulnerability to addiction.},

abstract = {Objective: This study examined racial/ethnic differences in alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use among a diverse sample of ap-proximately 5,500 seventh and eighth graders. We also evaluated the extent to which individual, family, and school factors mediated racial/ ethnic disparities in use. Method: Students (49{\%} male) from 16 partici-pating middle schools in southern California reported on lifetime and past-month substance use, individual factors (expectancies and resistance self-effi cacy), family factors (familism, parental respect, and adult and older sibling use), and school factors (school-grade use and perceived peer use). We used generalized estimating equations to examine the odds of consumption for each racial/ethnic group adjusting for sex, grade, and family structure. Path analysis models tested mediation of racial/ethnic differences through individual, family, and school factors. Results: After adjusting for sex, grade, and family structure, Hispanics reported higher and Asians reported lower lifetime and past-month substance use, compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians. Rates of substance use did not differ between non-Hispanic African Americans and Caucasians. Several individual factors mediated the relationship between Hispanic ethnicity and substance use, including negative expectancies and resistance self-effi cacy. Higher use among Hispanics was generally not explained by family or school factors. By contrast, several factors mediated the rela-tionship between Asian race and lower alcohol use, including individual, family (parental respect, adult and older sibling use), and school (per-ceived peer use, school-grade use) factors. Conclusions: Results high-light the importance of targeting specifi c individual, family, and school factors in tailored intervention efforts to reduce substance use among young minority adolescents.

abstract = {1. Review of published ecological studies using path analysis suggests that path anal- ysis is often misused and collinearity is a moderate to severe problem in a majority of the analyses. 2. Multiple regression is shown to be related to path analysis, and thus collinearity, which is a well-known problem in regression analysis, can also be a problem in path analysis. Collinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated and causes estimates of standardized partial regression coefficients and of path coefficients to be less precise, less accurate and prone to rounding error. 3. A review of 24 path analyses in 12 papers revealed incorrectly calculated path coef- ficients in 13 cases and problems with collinearity in 15 cases. Estimates of path coef- ficients are biased and lack precision if there is collinearity. 4. An additional 40 path analyses could not be evaluated because of incomplete infor- mation. Most studies lack sufficient sample size to justify the use of path analysis. Problems associated with the use of categorical variables, which were used in six cases, are unappreciated. 5. These problems suggest that path coefficients may often mislead ecologists about the relative importance of ecological processes.},

Our goals in this article are to (a) outline some general desiderata for effect size measures, (b) describe current methods of expressing effect size and practical importance for mediation, (c) use the desiderata to evaluate these methods, and (d) develop new methods to communicate effect size in the context of mediation analysis. The first new effect size index we describe is a residual-based index that quantifies the amount of variance explained in both the mediator and the outcome. The second new effect size index quantifies the indirect effect as the proportion of the maximum possible indirect effect that could have been obtained, given the scales of the variables involved. We supplement our discussion by offering easy-to-use R tools for the numerical and visual communication of effect size for mediation effects.},

abstract = {Within the framework of statistical learning theory we analyze in detail the so-called elastic-net regularization scheme proposed by Zou and Hastie [H. Zou, T. Hastie, Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net, J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B, 67(2) (2005) 301-320] for the selection of groups of correlated variables. To investigate the statistical properties of this scheme and in particular its consistency properties, we set up a suitable mathematical framework. Our setting is random-design regression where we allow the response variable to be vector-valued and we consider prediction functions which are linear combinations of elements (features) in an infinite-dimensional dictionary. Under the assumption that the regression function admits a sparse representation on the dictionary, we prove that there exists a particular "elastic-net representation" of the regression function such that, if the number of data increases, the elastic-net estimator is consistent not only for prediction but also for variable/feature selection. Our results include finite-sample bounds and an adaptive scheme to select the regularization parameter. Moreover, using convex analysis tools, we derive an iterative thresholding algorithm for computing the elastic-net solution which is different from the optimization procedure originally proposed in the above-cited work. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Mental health and substance use disorders among children, youth, and young adults are major threats to the health and well-being of younger populations which often carryover into adulthood. The costs of treatment for mental health and addictive disorders, which create an enormous burden on the affected individuals, their families, and society, have stimulated increasing interest in prevention practices that can impede the onset or reduce the severity of the disorders. Prevention practices have emerged in a variety of settings, including programs for selected at-risk populations (such as children and youth in the child welfare system), school-based interventions, interventions in primary care settings, and community services designed to address a broad array of mental health needs and populations. Preventing Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Disorders Among Young People updates a 1994 Institute of Medicine book, Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders, focusing special attention on the research base and program experience with younger populations that have emerged since that time. Researchers, such as those involved in prevention science, mental health, education, substance abuse, juvenile justice, health, child and youth development, as well as policy makers involved in state and local mental health, substance abuse, welfare, education, and justice will depend on this updated information on the status of research and suggested directions for the field of mental health and prevention of disorders.},

abstract = {Reduction of the high dimensional binary classification data using penalized logistic regression is one of the challenges when the explanatory variables are correlated. To tackle both estimating the coefficients and performing the variable selection simultaneously, elastic net penalty was successfully applied in high dimensional binary classification. However, elastic net has two major limitations. First it does not encourage grouping effects when there is no high correlation. Second, it is not consistent in variable selection. To address these issues, an adjusted of the elastic net (AEN) and its adaptive adjusted elastic net (AAEM), are proposed to take into account the small and medium correlation between explanatory variables and to provide the consistency of the variable selection simultaneously. Our simulation and real data results show that AEN and AAEN have advantage with small, medium, and extremely correlated variables in terms of both prediction and variable selection consistency comparing with other existing penalized methods.},

Typically, these studies are framed in terms of moderated mediation or mediated moderation, both of which involve similar analytical approaches. Unfortunately, these approaches have important shortcomings that conceal the nature of the moderated and the mediated effects under investigation. This article presents a general analytical framework for combining moderation and mediation that integrates moderated regression analysis and path analysis. This framework clarifies how moderator variables influence the paths that constitute the direct, indirect, and total effects of mediated models. The authors empirically illustrate this framework and give step-by-step instructions for estimation and interpretation. They summarize the advantages of their framework over current approaches, explain how it subsumes moderated mediation and mediated moderation, and describe how it can accommodate additional moderator and mediator variables, curvilinear relationships, and structural equation models with latent variables.},

The authors considered the possibility that longitudinal mediation might occur under either of two different models of change: (a) an autoregressive model or (b) a random effects model. For both models, the authors demonstrated that cross-sectional approaches to mediation typically generate substantially biased estimates of longitudinal parameters even under the ideal conditions when mediation is complete. In longitudinal models where variable M completely mediates the effect of X on Y, cross-sectional estimates of the direct effect of X on Y, the indirect effect of X on Y through M, and the proportion of the total effect mediated by M are often highly misleading.

In the second domain, we show how the effects of self-esteem and narcissism operate consistently as mutual suppressors: That is, adding narcissism into a regression equation increases the negative association between self-esteem and antisocial behavior, whereas adding self-esteem increases the positive association between narcissism and antisocial behavior.

Using an objective measure of research expertise (number of publications), we found that expertise predicted larger replication effect sizes. The effect sizes selected and obtained by high-expertise replication teams was nearly twice as large as that obtained by low-expertise teams, particularly in replications of social psychology effects. Surprisingly, this effect seemed to be explained by experts choosing studies to replicate that had larger original effect sizes. There was little evidence that expertise predicted avoiding red flags (i.e. the troubling trio) or studies that varied in execution difficulty. However, experts did choose studies that were less context sensitive. Our results suggest that experts achieve greater replication success, in part, because they choose more robust and generalizable studies to replicate.},

abstract = {Problems with measuring socioeconomic status (SES)—frequently included in clinical and public health studies as a control variable and less frequently as the variable(s) of main interest—could affect research findings and con- clusions, with implications for practice and policy.We critically examine standard SES measurement approaches, illustrating problems with examples from new analyses and the literature. For example, marked racial/ethnic differences in income at a given educational level and in wealth at a given in- come level raise questions about the socioeconomic comparability of indi- viduals who are similar on education or income alone. Evidence also shows that conclusions about nonsocioeconomic causes of racial/ethnic differ- ences in health may depend on the measure—eg, income, wealth, educa- tion, occupation, neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, or past so- cioeconomic experiences—used to “control for SES,” suggesting that findings from studies that have measured limited aspects of SES should be reas- sessed. We recommend an outcome- and social group–specific approach to SES measurement that involves (1) considering plausible explanatory path- ways and mechanisms, (2) measuring as much relevant socioeconomic in- formation as possible, (3) specifying the particular socioeconomic factors measured (rather than SES overall), and (4) systematically considering how potentially important unmeasured socioeconomic factors may affect con- clusions. Better SES measures are needed in data sources, but improve- ments could be made by using existing information more thoughtfully and acknowledging its limitations.},

abstract = {Studies have suggested that subjective social status (SSS) is an important predictor of health. This study examined the link between SSS and health in old age and investigated whether SSS mediated the associations between objective indicators of socioeconomic status and health. It used cross- sectional data from the second wave (2004–05) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, which were collected through personal interviews and nurse visits. The study population consisted of 3368 men and 4065 women aged 52 years or older. The outcome measures included: self-rated health, long-standing illness, depression, hypertension, diabetes, central obesity, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein. The main independent variable was SSS measured using a scale representing a 10-rung ladder. Wealth, education, and occupational class were employed as covariates along with age and marital status and also, in additional analyses, as the main independent variables. Gender-specific logistic and linear regression analyses were performed. In age-adjusted analyses SSS was related positively to almost all health outcomes. Many of these relationships remained significant after adjustment for covariates. In men, SSS was significantly (p≤0.05) related to self-rated health, depression, and long-standing illness after adjustment for all covariates, while its association with fibrinogen became non-significant. In women, after adjusting for all covariates, SSS was significantly associated with self-rated health, depression, long-standing illness, diabetes, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but its associations with central obesity and C-reactive protein became non-significant. Further analysis suggested that SSS mediated fully or partially the associations between education, occupational class and self-reported and clinical health measures. On the contrary, SSS did not mediate wealth's associations with the outcome measures, except those with self-reported health measures. Our results suggest that SSS is an important correlate of health in old age, possibly because of its ability to epitomize life-time achievement and socioeconomic status. Correspondence},

@article{Winkleby1992,
abstract = {BACKGROUND. Socioeconomic status (SES) is usually measured by determining education, income, occupation, or a composite of these dimensions. Although education is the most commonly used measure of SES in epidemiological studies, no investigators in the United States have conducted an empirical analysis quantifying the relative impact of each separate dimension of SES on risk factors for disease. METHODS. Using data on 2380 participants from the Stanford Five-City Project (85{\%} White, non-Hispanic), we examined the independent contribution of education, income, and occupation to a set of cardiovascular disease risk factors (cigarette smoking, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). RESULTS. The relationship between these SES measures and risk factors was strongest and most consistent for education, showing higher risk associated with lower levels of education. Using a forward selection model that allowed for inclusion of all three SES measures after adjustment for age and time of survey, education was the only measure that was significantly associated with the risk factors (P less than .05). CONCLUSION. If economics or time dictate that a single parameter of SES be chosen and if the research hypothesis does not dictate otherwise, higher education may be the best SES predictor of good health},

First, low SES was associated with poorer diets, less physical activity, and greater cigarette smoking. Second, there was no clear pattern of associations between SES and alcohol consumption or marijuana use.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:Results from this review indicate that, although some associations between SES and health behaviors exist during adolescence, the associations are not as robust as those in adulthood. Efforts to curb poor diet, inactivity, and smoking behaviors should target low SES adolescents, whereas efforts to curb teen drinking and marijuana use may be useful across the SES spectrum.},

Research in the first part of this era examined the nature of the relationship of SES and health, revealing a graded association; SES is important to health not only for those in poverty, but at all levels of SES. On average, the more advantaged individuals are, the better their health. In this paper we examine the data regarding the SES-health gradient, addressing causal direction, generalizability across populations and diseases, and associations with health for different indicators of SES. In the most recent era, researchers are increasingly exploring the mechanisms by which SES exerts an influence on health. There are multiple pathways by which SES determines health; a comprehensive analysis must include macroeconomic contexts and social factors as well as more immediate social environments, individual psychological and behavioral factors, and biological predispositions and processes.},

abstract = {Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson (2001) show that the well-known relationship between socio- economic status (SES) and health exists in childhood and grows more pronounced with age. However, in cross-sectional data it is difficult to distinguish between two possible explanations. The first is that low-SES children are less able to respond to a given health shock. The second is that low SES children experience more shocks. We show, using panel data on Canadian children that: 1) the gradient we estimate in the cross section is very similar to that estimated previously using U.S. children; 2) both high and low-SES children recover from past health shocks to about the same degree; and 3) that the relationship between SES and health grows stronger over time mainly because low-SES children receive more negative health shocks. In addition, we examine the effect of health shocks on math and reading scores. We find that health shocks affect test scores and future health in very similar ways. Our results suggest that public policy aimed at reducing SES-related health differentials in children should focus on reducing the incidence of health shocks as well as on reducing disparities in access to palliative care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adjustment for prognostic covariates can lead to increased power in the analysis of randomized trials. However, adjusted analyses are not often performed in practice. METHODS: We used simulation to examine the impact of covariate adjustment on 12 outcomes from 8 studies across a range of therapeutic areas. We assessed (1) how large an increase in power can be expected in practice; and (2) the impact of adjustment for covariates that are not prognostic. RESULTS: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates led to large increases in power for most outcomes. When power was set to 80{\%} based on an unadjusted analysis, covariate adjustment led to a median increase in power to 92.6{\%} across the 12 outcomes (range 80.6 to 99.4{\%}). Power was increased to over 85{\%} for 8 of 12 outcomes, and to over 95{\%} for 5 of 12 outcomes. Conversely, the largest decrease in power from adjustment for covariates that were not prognostic was from 80{\%} to 78.5{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates can lead to substantial increases in power, and should be routinely incorporated into the analysis of randomized trials. The potential benefits of adjusting for a small number of possibly prognostic covariates in trials with moderate or large sample sizes far outweigh the risks of doing so, and so should also be considered.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p {\textgreater} n case.

Failing to control for valid covariates can yield biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses or in imperfectly randomized experiments and contributes to underpowered analyses even in effectively randomized experiments. We introduce double-lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection. The double lasso method is calibrated to not over-select potentially spurious covariates, and simulations demonstrate that using this method reduces error and increases statistical power. This method can be used to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomization. We illustrate both the method's usefulness and how to implement it in practice by applying it to four analyses from the prior literature, using both correlational and experimental data.},

In addition, attrition rate misled them to draw a logical yet false conclusion: that explaining one's view on gun rights decreases progun sentiment (Study 3).

abstract = {BACKGROUND The purpose of this study is to propose the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators procedure (LASSO) as an alternative to conventional variable selection models, as it allows for easy interpretation and handles multicollinearities. We developed a model on the basis of LASSO-selected parameters in order to link associated demographical, socio-economical, clinical and immunological factors to performing tuberculosis screening in HIV-positive patients in Ghana. METHODS Applying the LASSO method and multivariate logistic regression analysis on a large public health data set, we selected relevant predictors related to tuberculosis screening. RESULTS One Thousand Ninety Five patients infected with HIV were enrolled into this study with 691 (63.2 {\%}) of them having tuberculosis screening documented in their patient folders. Predictors found to be significantly associated with performance of tuberculosis screening can be classified into factors related to the clinician's perception of the clinical state, as well as those related to PLHIV's awareness. These factors include newly diagnosed HIV infections (n = 354 (32.42 {\%}), aOR 1.84), current CD4+ T cell count (aOR 0.92), non-availability of HIV type (n = 787 (72.07 {\%}), aOR 0.56), chronic cough (n = 32 (2.93 {\%}), aOR 5.07), intake of co-trimoxazole (n = 271 (24.82 {\%}), aOR 2.31), vitamin supplementation (n = 220 (20.15 {\%}), aOR 2.64) as well as the use of mosquito bed nets (n = 613 (56.14 {\%}), aOR 1.53). CONCLUSIONS Accelerated TB screening among newly diagnosed HIV-patients indicates that application of the WHO screening form for intensifying tuberculosis case finding among HIV-positive individuals in resource-limited settings is increasingly adopted. However, screening for TB in PLHIV is still impacted by clinician's perception of patient's health state and PLHIV's health awareness. Education of staff, counselling of PLHIV and sufficient financing are needed for further improvement in implementation of TB screening for all PLHIV. The LASSO approach proved a convenient method for automatic variable selection in a large public health data set that requires efficient and fast algorithms.

abstract = {Intermountain Healthcare is a high-performing health system and a recognized leader in quality improvement. We use a clinical integration strategy focused on eight clinical programs to support the practice of evidence-based care. Accelerated improvements that enhance patient safety, clinical excellence, and operational efficiency are tested and then spread across the system via care process models and program-specific board goals. While we have nearly 60 evidence-based care process models in place (in addition to multiple operational effectiveness initiatives), we provide three exemplars to illustrate cost savings and the relative impact on hospital/medical group versus payer benefit. These clinical best practices include very early lung recruitment (VE LR) for neonates with respiratory distress syndrome, guidelines for elective inductions in labor and delivery, and prevention of congestive heart failure (CHF) readmissions. Due to perverse incentives in the third party payment system--where healthcare providers are often paid to do more tests and treatments as opposed to providing clinical value--doing what's right for our patients commonly yields savings to our payers while negatively impacting the delivery system budget. In this article, we present a suggested strategy for negotiated capture of these savings.},

abstract = {It has been estimated that full implementation of the Affordable Care Act will extend coverage to thirty-two million previously uninsured Americans. However, rapidly rising health care costs could thwart that effort. Since 1988 Intermountain Healthcare has applied to health care delivery the insights of W. Edwards Deming's process management theory, which says that the best way to reduce costs is to improve quality. Intermountain achieved such quality-based savings through measuring, understanding, and managing variation among clinicians in providing care. Intermountain created data systems and management structures that increased accountability, drove improvement, and produced savings. For example, a new delivery protocol helped reduce rates of elective induced labor, unplanned cesarean sections, and admissions to newborn intensive care units. That one protocol saves an estimated {\$}50 million in Utah each year. If applied nationally, it would save about {\$}3.5 billion. "Organized care" along these lines may be central to the long-term success of health reform.},

The method is termed regularized structural equation modeling (RegSEM). RegSEM penalizes specific parameters in structural equation models, with the goal of creating easier to understand and simpler models. Although regularization has gained wide adoption in regression, very little has transferred to models with latent variables. By adding penalties to specific parameters in a structural equation model, researchers have a high level of flexibility in reducing model complexity, overcoming poor fitting models, and the creation of models that are more likely to generalize to new samples. The proposed method was evaluated through a simulation study, two illustrative examples involving a measurement model, and one empirical example involving the structural part of the model to demonstrate RegSEM's utility},

abstract = {Numerous variable selection methods rely on a two-stage procedure, where a sparsity-inducing penalty is used in the first stage to predict the support, which is then conveyed to the second stage for estimation or inference purposes. In this framework, the first stage screens variables to find a set of possibly relevant variables and the second stage operates on this set of candidate variables, to improve estimation accuracy or to assess the uncertainty associated to the selection of variables. We advocate that more information can be conveyed from the first stage to the second one: we use the magnitude of the coefficients estimated in the first stage to define an adaptive penalty that is applied at the second stage. We give two examples of procedures that can benefit from the proposed transfer of information, in estimation and inference problems respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this transfer is particularly efficient when each stage operates on distinct subsamples. This separation plays a crucial role for the computation of calibrated p-values, allowing to control the False Discovery Rate. In this setup, the proposed transfer results in sensitivity gains ranging from 50{\%} to 100{\%} compared to state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Individual differences that confer risk and resiliency should be considered when examining lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) health. Stigma consciousness in LGB has been directly associated with poorer self-reported mental health and, to a much lesser extent, physical health. Psychological hardiness, a personality trait characterized by control, commitment, and challenge, has been shown to be directly associated with better health in non-LGB populations. The current study tested the direct effects of psychological hardiness and stigma consciousness on self-reported health in LGB. As exploratory aims, the interaction between stigma consciousness and hardiness and the interrelationship between stigma consciousness and perceived discrimination from family and friends was examined. A sample of 277 LGB adults completed a 1-time online questionnaire assessing stigma consciousness, perceived discrim- ination from family and friends, and self-reported health. Results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that stigma consciousness was directly associated with greater psychological distress, as well as poorer self-reported physical health. The relationship between greater stigma consciousness and more physical symptoms depended on the level of hardiness. Individuals with low hardiness and high stigma consciousness reported being bothered the most by physical symptoms. Furthermore, the associations between stigma consciousness and self-reported health were fully mediated by perceived discrimination from family and friends. The current study corroborates and extends past work on the association between stigma consciousness and self-reported mental health. Finally, the current study indicates that hardiness may be important to examine both directly and as a moderator in future minority stress-health research in LGB populations.},

abstract = {Sexual minority youth (youth who are attracted to the same sex or endorse a gay/lesbian/bisexual identity) report significantly higher rates of depression and suicidality than heterosexual youth. The minority stress hypothesis contends that the stigma and discrimination experienced by sexual minority youth create a hostile social environment that can lead to chronic stress and mental health problems. The present study used longitudinal mediation models to directly test sexual minority-specific victimization as a potential explanatory mechanism of the mental health disparities of sexual minority youth. One hundred ninety-seven adolescents (14-19 years old; 70 {\%} female; 29 {\%} sexual minority) completed measures of sexual minority-specific victimization, depressive symptoms, and suicidality at two time points 6 months apart. Compared to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth reported higher levels of sexual minority-specific victimization, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. Sexual minority-specific victimization significantly mediated the effect of sexual minority status on depressive symptoms and suicidality. The results support the minority stress hypothesis that targeted harassment and victimization are partly responsible for the higher levels of depressive symptoms and suicidality found in sexual minority youth. This research lends support to public policy initiatives that reduce bullying and hate crimes because reducing victimization can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of sexual minority youth.},

We assessed mental disorders by administering a structured di- agnostic interview to a community sample of 246 LGBT youths aged 16 to 20 years. Participants also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI 18). Results. One third of participants met criteria for any mental disorder, 17{\%} for conduct disorder, 15{\%} for major depression, and 9{\%} for posttraumatic stress disorder. Anorexia and bulimia were rare. Lifetime suicide attempts were frequent (31{\%}) but less so in the prior 12 months (7{\%}). Few racial/ethnic and gender differences were statistically significant. Bisexually identified youths had lower prevalences of every diagnosis. The BSI 18 had high negative predictive power (90{\%}) and low positive predictive power (25{\%}) for major depression. Conclusions. LGBT youths had higher prevalences of mental disorder di- agnoses than youths in national samples, but were similar to representative samples of urban, racial/ethnic minority youths. Suicide behaviors were similar to those among representative youth samples in the same geographic area. Questionnaires measuring psychological distress may overestimate depression prevalence among this population.},

We drew on Hatzenbuehler's (2009) psychological mediation framework and Lick, Durso, and Johnson's (2013) conceptual pathways to lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) physical health disparities to test a serial mediation model in which 2 types of cognitive appraisals (proximal minority stressors and coping self-efficacy) partially account for the association between perceived discrimination and prejudice (distal minority stressor) and self-reported physical health symptoms in a nationally recruited sample of 564 LGB individuals (270 women, 294 men) who participated in a web-based survey. Results indicated that perceived experiences of discrimination and prejudice were associated with expectations of rejection and internalized homonegativity. These 2 proximal stressors were associated with lower coping self-efficacy, and the combined cognitive appraisal pathways were associated with higher levels of self-reported physical symptom severity. The pathway through emotion-focused coping self-efficacy was particularly salient in accounting for the overall mediation. Interventions to address distal and proximal minority stressors and improve emotion-focused coping self-efficacy may be particularly helpful in reducing the negative effects of stigma on physical health.

abstract = {Although epidemiologic studies have established the existence of large sexual orientation disparities in illicit drug use among adolescents and young adults, the determinants of these disparities remain understudied. This study sought to determine whether sexual orientation disparities in illicit drug use are potentiated in states that are characterized by high levels of stigma surrounding sexual minorities. State-level structural stigma was coded using a previously established measure based on a 4-item composite index: (1) density of same-sex couples; (2) proportion of Gay-Straight Alliances per public high school; (3) 5 policies related to sexual orientation discrimination (e.g., same-sex marriage, employment non-discrimination); and (4) public opinion toward homosexuality (aggregated responses from 41 national polls). The index was linked to individual-level data from the Growing Up Today Study, a prospective community-based study of adolescents (2001-2010). Sexual minorities report greater illicit drug use than their heterosexual peers. However, for both men and women, there were statistically significant interactions between sexual orientation status and structural stigma, such that sexual orientation disparities in marijuana and illicit drug use were more pronounced in high-structural stigma states than in low-structural stigma states, controlling for individual- and state-level confounders. For instance, among men, the risk ratio indicating the association between sexual orientation and marijuana use was 24{\%} greater in high- versus low-structural stigma states, and for women it was 28{\%} greater in high- versus low-structural stigma states. Stigma in the form of social policies and attitudes may contribute to sexual orientation disparities in illicit drug use.},

In a variety of occupational settings, LGB workers experience employment-based harassment and discrimination. Work is an important aspect of life for the majority of the population, yet many LGB workers are prevented from fully participating in job-related activities and are inhibited from career advancement opportunities due to existing social stigmas. This problem contributes to a stigma consciousness among LGB workers and affects their decision to be “out” at work. This descriptive study examines the experiences of stigma conscious- ness and outness among 215 LGB people living in a large Midwest city. The findings suggest a marginal relationship between outness and stigma consciousness; however, the results indicate the need for a change in social policy and the importance of the counseling practice in combating stigma consciousness, which are explored here.

Results indicate that men with histories of childhood and adult sexual victimization are more likely to report substance use, more lifetime STIs, higher sexual compulsivity scores, and greater gay-related stigma scores than men with no histories of sexual victimization. Few differences are found in comparisons of health outcomes based on age at first sexual victimization (childhood vs. adulthood). Furthermore, men with histories of sexual victimization report healthier coping skills than men with no histories of sexual victimization, but no significant group differences are found in social support or stress-related growth. Findings underscore the importance of assessing lifetime sexual victimization among sexual minority men during counseling, with special attention given to the enhancement of protective factors among those at risk for harmful behaviors and subsequent poor health outcomes.},

abstract = {Family support and rejection are associated with health outcomes among sexual minority women (SMW). We examined a social ecological development model among young adult SMW, testing whether identity risk factors or outness to family interacted with family rejection to predict community connectedness and collective self-esteem. Lesbian and bisexual women (N = 843; 57{\%} bisexual) between the ages of 18-25 (M = 21.4; SD = 2.1) completed baseline and 12-month online surveys. The sample identified as White (54.2{\%}), multiple racial backgrounds (16.6{\%}), African American (9.6{\%}) and Asian/Asian American (3.1{\%}); 10.2{\%} endorsed a Hispanic/Latina ethnicity. Rejection ranged from 18 to 41{\%} across family relationships. Longitudinal regression indicated that when outness to family increased, SMW in highly rejecting families demonstrated resilience by finding connections and esteem in sexual minority communities to a greater extent than did non-rejected peers. But, when stigma concerns, concealment motivation, and other identity risk factors increased over the year, high family rejection did not impact community connectedness and SMW reported lower collective self-esteem. Racial minority SMW reported lower community connectedness, but not lower collective self-esteem. Families likely buffer or exacerbate societal risks for ill health. Findings highlight the protective role of LGBTQ communities and normative resilience among SMW and their families.},

abstract = {Individuals with concealable stigmatized identities face many options regarding whether, when, how, and to whom to conceal or disclose information about their marginalized social status. Numerous studies have examined the psychosocial health consequences of different stigma concealment and disclosure processes, but research in this area is hindered by a relative lack of attention to potential differences among these stigma management variables. The present research investigated the distinctness of stigma management constructs in a population viewed as holding an indiscernible stigmatized identity: lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) university students. In Study 1, the psychometric properties of a 6-item measure assessing recent effortful concealment of sexual orientation were examined in a sample of 353 LGB university students. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in separate subsamples supported the hypothesized single factor structure, and offered preliminary support for the reliability and validity of scores. In Study 2, 301 LGB university students completed an online survey including 3 measures of stigma management: concealment behavior, concealment motivation, and nondisclosure. Also included were measures of psychological health (depression, life satisfaction), negative social identity (self-stigma, acceptance concerns), and positive social identity (membership esteem, identity strength). Each stigma management variable uniquely predicted a different combination of psychosocial variables, supporting the notion that each is a distinct construct. Concealment behavior uniquely predicted psychological health and negative identity variables, concealment motivation uniquely predicted positive and negative identity variables, and nondisclosure uniquely predicted positive identity variables. Implications of these results are discussed in light of literature on management of indiscernible stigmatized identities. Keywords:},

In this article we combine these two classical ideas together to produce LAD-lasso. Compared with the LAD regression, LAD-lasso can do parameter estimation and variable selection simultaneously. Compared with the traditional lasso, LAD-lasso is resistant to heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the re- sponse. Furthermore, with easily estimated tuning parameters, the LAD-lasso estimator enjoys the same asymptotic efficiency as the unpenalized LAD estimator obtained under the true model (i.e., the oracle property). Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite-sample performance of LAD-lasso, and a real example is analyzed for illustration purposes.},

abstract = {Stigma occurs at both individual and structural levels, but existing research tends to examine the effect of individual and structural forms of stigma in isolation, rather than considering potential synergistic effects. To address this gap, our study examined whether stigma at the individual level, namely gay-related rejection sensitivity, interacts with structural stigma to predict substance use among young sexual minority men. Sexual minority (n=119) participants completed online measures of our constructs (e.g., rejection sensitivity). Participants currently resided across a broad array of geographic areas (i.e., 24 U.S. states), and had attended high school in 28 states, allowing us to capture sufficient variance in current and past forms of structural stigma, defined as (1) a lack of state-level policies providing equal opportunities for heterosexual and sexual minority individuals and (2) negative state-aggregated attitudes toward sexual minorities. To measure daily substance use, we utilized a daily diary approach, whereby all participants were asked to indicate whether they used tobacco or alcohol on nine consecutive days. Results indicated that structural stigma interacted with rejection sensitivity to predict tobacco and alcohol use, and that this relationship depended on the developmental timing of exposure to structural stigma. In contrast, rejection sensitivity did not mediate the relationship between structural stigma and substance use. These results suggest that psychological predispositions, such as rejection sensitivity, interact with features of the social environment, such as structural stigma, to predict important health behaviors among young sexual minority men. These results add to a growing body of research documenting the multiple levels through which stigma interacts to produce negative health outcomes among sexual minority individuals. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Parent training for foster parents is mandated by federal law and supported by state statues in nearly all states; however, little is known about the efficacy of that training, and recent reviews underscore that the most widely used curricula in the child welfare system (CWS) have virtually no empirical support (Grimm, Youth Law News, April–June:3–29, 2003). On the other hand, numerous theoretically based, developmentally sensitive parent training interventions have been found to be effective in experimental clinical and prevention intervention trials (e.g., Kazdin and Wassell, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 39:414–420, 2000; McMahon and Forehand, Helping the noncompliant child, Guilford Press, New York, USA, 2003; Patterson and Forgatch, Parents and adolescents: I. Living together, Castalia Publishing, Eugene, OR, USA, 1987; Webster-Stratton et al., Journal of Clinical Child Pyschology Psychiatry, 42:943–952, 2001). One of these, Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC; Chamberlain, Treating chronic juvenile offenders: Advances made through the Oregon Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care model, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, USA, 2003), has been used with foster parents of youth referred from juvenile justice. The effectiveness of a universal intervention, KEEP (Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported) based on MTFC (but less intensive) was tested in a universal randomized trial with 700 foster and kinship parents in the San Diego County CWS. The goal of the intervention was to reduce child problem behaviors through strengthening foster parents' skills. The trial was designed to examine effects on both child behavior and parenting practices, allowing for specific assessment of the extent to which improvements in child behavior were mediated by the parenting practices targeted in the intervention. Child behavior problems were reduced significantly more in the intervention condition than in the control condition, and specific parenting practices were found to mediate these reductions, especially for high-risk children in foster families reporting more than six behavior problems per day at baseline.},

abstract = {In many scientific studies, it becomes increasingly important to delineate the causal pathways through a large number of mediators, such as genetic and brain mediators. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a popular technique to estimate the pathway effects, commonly expressed as products of coefficients. However, it becomes unstable to fit such models with high dimensional mediators, especially for a general setting where all the mediators are causally dependent but the exact causal relationships between them are unknown. This paper proposes a sparse mediation model using a regularized SEM approach, where sparsity here means that a small number of mediators have nonzero mediation effects between a treatment and an outcome. To address the model selection challenge, we innovate by introducing a new penalty called Pathway Lasso. This penalty function is a convex relaxation of the non-convex product function, and it enables a computationally tractable optimization criterion to estimate and select many pathway effects simultaneously. We develop a fast ADMM-type algorithm to compute the model parameters, and we show that the iterative updates can be expressed in closed form. On both simulated data and a real fMRI dataset, the proposed approach yields higher pathway selection accuracy and lower estimation bias than other competing methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic selection (GS) is emerging as an efficient and cost-effective method for estimating breeding values using molecular markers distributed over the entire genome. In essence, it involves estimating the simultaneous effects of all genes or chromosomal segments and combining the estimates to predict the total genomic breeding value (GEBV). Accurate prediction of GEBVs is a central and recurring challenge in plant and animal breeding. The existence of a bewildering array of approaches for predicting breeding values using markers underscores the importance of identifying approaches able to efficiently and accurately predict breeding values. Here, we comparatively evaluate the predictive performance of six regularized linear regression methods-- ridge regression, ridge regression BLUP, lasso, adaptive lasso, elastic net and adaptive elastic net-- for predicting GEBV using dense SNP markers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We predicted GEBVs for a quantitative trait using a dataset on 3000 progenies of 20 sires and 200 dams and an accompanying genome consisting of five chromosomes with 9990 biallelic SNP-marker loci simulated for the QTL-MAS 2011 workshop. We applied all the six methods that use penalty-based (regularization) shrinkage to handle datasets with far more predictors than observations. The lasso, elastic net and their adaptive extensions further possess the desirable property that they simultaneously select relevant predictive markers and optimally estimate their effects. The regression models were trained with a subset of 2000 phenotyped and genotyped individuals and used to predict GEBVs for the remaining 1000 progenies without phenotypes. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the root mean squared error, the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and (1) the true genomic value (TGV), (2) the true breeding value (TBV) and (3) the simulated phenotypic values based on fivefold cross-validation (CV).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The elastic net, lasso, adaptive lasso and the adaptive elastic net all had similar accuracies but outperformed ridge regression and ridge regression BLUP in terms of the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and the true genomic value as well as the root mean squared error. The performance of RR-BLUP was also somewhat better than that of ridge regression. This pattern was replicated by the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and the true breeding values (TBV) and the root mean squared error calculated with respect to TBV, except that accuracy was lower for all models, most especially for the adaptive elastic net. The correlation between the predicted GEBV and simulated phenotypic values based on the fivefold CV also revealed a similar pattern except that the adaptive elastic net had lower accuracy than both the ridge regression methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: All the six models had relatively high prediction accuracies for the simulated data set. Accuracy was higher for the lasso type methods than for ridge regression and ridge regression BLUP.},

abstract = {The Lasso is an attractive regularisation method for high-dimensional regression. It combines variable selection with an efficient computational procedure. However, the rate of convergence of the Lasso is slow for some sparse high-dimensional data, where the number of predictor variables is growing fast with the number of observations. Moreover, many noise variables are selected if the estimator is chosen by cross-validation. It is shown that the contradicting demands of an efficient computational procedure and fast convergence rates of the ℓ2-loss can be overcome by a two-stage procedure, termed the relaxed Lasso. For orthogonal designs, the relaxed Lasso provides a continuum of solutions that include both soft- and hard-thresholding of estimators. The relaxed Lasso solutions include all regular Lasso solutions and computation of all relaxed Lasso solutions is often identically expensive as computing all regular Lasso solutions. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the relaxed Lasso produces sparser models with equal or lower prediction loss than the regular Lasso estimator for high-dimensional data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The new second generation sequencing technology revolutionizes many biology-related research fields and poses various computational biology challenges. One of them is transcriptome assembly based on RNA-Seq data, which aims at reconstructing all full-length mRNA transcripts simultaneously from millions of short reads. In this article, we consider three objectives in transcriptome assembly: the maximization of prediction accuracy, minimization of interpretation, and maximization of completeness. The first objective, the maximization of prediction accuracy, requires that the estimated expression levels based on assembled transcripts should be as close as possible to the observed ones for every expressed region of the genome. The minimization of interpretation follows the parsimony principle to seek as few transcripts in the prediction as possible. The third objective, the maximization of completeness, requires that the maximum number of mapped reads (or ?expressed segments? in gene models) be explained by (i.e., contained in) the predicted transcripts in the solution. Based on the above three objectives, we present IsoLasso, a new RNA-Seq based transcriptome assembly tool. IsoLasso is based on the well-known LASSO algorithm, a multivariate regression method designated to seek a balance between the maximization of prediction accuracy and the minimization of interpretation. By including some additional constraints in the quadratic program involved in LASSO, IsoLasso is able to make the set of assembled transcripts as complete as possible. Experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq datasets show that IsoLasso achieves, simultaneously, higher sensitivity and precision than the state-of-art transcript assembly tools.},

While their theoretical properties are well-understood, specific methodology for their optimal application to genomic data has not been determined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Through simulation of contrasting scenarios of correlated high-dimensional survival data, we compared the LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net penalties for prediction and variable selection. We found that a 2D tuning of the Elastic Net penalties was necessary to avoid mimicking the performance of LASSO or Ridge regression. Furthermore, we found that in a simulated scenario favoring the LASSO penalty, a univariate pre-filter made the Elastic Net behave more like Ridge regression, which was detrimental to prediction performance. We demonstrate the real-life application of these methods to predicting the survival of cancer patients from microarray data, and to classification of obese and lean individuals from metagenomic data. Based on these results, we provide an optimized set of guidelines for the application of penalized regression for reproducible class comparison and prediction with genomic data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A parallelized implementation of the methods presented for regression and for simulation of synthetic data is provided as the pensim R package, available at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pensim/index.html.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: chuttenh@hsph.harvard.edu; juris@ai.utoronto.ca$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {In multiple regression problems when covariates can be naturally grouped, it is important to carry out feature selection at the group and within-group individual variable levels simultaneously. The existing methods, including the lasso and group lasso, are designed for either variable selection or group selection, but not for both. We propose a group bridge approach that is capable of simultaneous selection at both the group and within-group individual variable levels. The proposed approach is a penalized regularization method that uses a specially designed group bridge penalty. It has the oracle group selection property, in that it can correctly select important groups with probability converging to one. In contrast, the group lasso and group least angle regression methods in general do not possess such an oracle property in group selection. Simulation studies indicate that the group bridge has superior performance in group and individual variable selection relative to several existing methods.},

abstract = {Speech and language are central to the human experience, and their acquisition is a seemingly automatic process that continues from birth through adolescence. The identification of speech and language disorders often occurs when a child does not achieve expected or normative develop- mental milestones. Such disorders impair a child's functioning, and when they are severe enough to disrupt a child's ability to communicate, they have especially serious consequences. In their most severe forms, moreover, such conditions can be expected to persist over a lifetime. When combined with other risks, such as poverty, severe speech and language disorders can increase risk for a wide variety of adverse outcomes, including social isolation and mental health disorders, learning disabilities, behavior disor- ders, poor academic achievement, and chronic underemployment. These outcomes—some of which can be mitigated through early identification and intervention—point to the array of needs children with speech and language disorders are likely to have and to the kinds of ongoing support they may require. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for children pro- vides financial assistance to children from low-income, resource-limited families who have been determined to have conditions that meet the dis- ability standard required under law. When sufficiently severe, speech and language disorders can qualify children for SSI disability assistance. Over the past several decades, the number of children receiving SSI has risen overall, and the number receiving SSI on the basis of speech and language disorders also has risen. A 2010 report issued by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found an increase between 2000 and 2010 in both applications and allowances (applicants determined to meet the disability criteria) for children with speech and language impairments. During this period, the number of applications for speech and language impairments increased from 21,615 to 49,664, while the number of chil- dren found to meet the disability criteria increased from 11,565 to 29,147. Based on the GAO's findings, the Social Security Administration (SSA) determined that additional research was needed to understand the increases in the number of children applying for and receiving SSI benefits on the basis of speech and language disorders. It is in the context of the changes observed in the SSI program for children that the SSA requested this study.},

Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. RESULTS: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. CONCLUSION: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

abstract = {Abstract  The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models—Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)—for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre-lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna-tional conference, * * * , 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Variance estimation in the linear model when p {\textgreater} n is a difficult problem. Standard least squares estimation techniques do not apply. Several variance estimators have been proposed in the literature, all with accompanying asymptotic results proving consistency and asymptotic normality under a variety of assumptions. It is found, however, that most of these estimators suffer large biases in finite samples when true underlying signals become less sparse with larger per element signal strength. One estimator seems to be largely neglected in the literature: a residual sum of squares based estimator using Lasso coefficients with regularisation parameter selected adaptively (via cross-validation). In this paper, we review several variance estimators and perform a reasonably extensive simulation study in an attempt to compare their finite sample performance. It would seem from the results that variance estimators with adaptively chosen regularisation parameters perform admirably over a broad range of sparsity and signal strength settings. Finally, some intial theoretical analyses pertaining to these types of estimators are proposed and developed.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {We implemented least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to evaluate gene effects in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain images, using an MRI-derived temporal lobe volume measure from 729 subjects scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Sparse groups of SNPs in individual genes were selected by LASSO, which identifies efficient sets of variants influencing the data. These SNPs were considered jointly when assessing their association with neuroimaging measures. We discovered 22 genes that passed genome-wide significance for influencing temporal lobe volume. This was a substantially greater number of significant genes compared to those found with standard, univariate GWAS. These top genes are all expressed in the brain and include genes previously related to brain function or neuropsychiatric disorders such as MACROD2, SORCS2, GRIN2B, MAGI2, NPAS3, CLSTN2, GABRG3, NRXN3, PRKAG2, GAS7, RBFOX1, ADARB2, CHD4, and CDH13. The top genes we identified with this method also displayed significant and widespread post hoc effects on voxelwise, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) maps of the temporal lobes. The most significantly associated gene was an autism susceptibility gene known as MACROD2. We were able to successfully replicate the effect of the MACROD2 gene in an independent cohort of 564 young, Australian healthy adult twins and siblings scanned with MRI (mean age: 23.8 +/- 2.2 SD years). Our approach powerfully complements univariate techniques in detecting influences of genes on the living brain.},

(2) Determine if a combination of these parenting practices has an effect on the outcome. Methods Chi square and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to analyze cross-sectional data from the National Survey of Children's Health 2011/2012 in regards to the relationship between each of the three individual PPP as well as a total PPP score and the child's risk of being developmentally, socially, or behaviorally delayed (N = 21,527). Risk of delay was calculated using the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status Questionnaire, which is a parental self-report measure that has been correlated with diagnosed child delays. These analyses controlled for poverty and parental education. All analyses were completed using SAS Version 9.3. Results A strong correlation was found between each of the three PPP as well as the total PPP score and the child's risk of developmental, social, or behavioral delays (p {\textless} 0.05 for each test). These associations were found to have a dose–response relationship (p {\textless} 0.05 in all but one analysis). Conclusions Daily engagement in PPP could possibly reduce children's risk of delay, and specifically engaging in all three PPP may have greater benefit.},

Results indicated no significant differences between the two groups on cognitive or self-concept measures.

abstract = {Background In the past, unilateral hearing loss (UHL) in children was thought to have little consequence because speech and language presumably developed appropriately with one normal-hearing ear. Some studies from the 1980s and 1990s have suggested that a significantly increased proportion of children with UHL may have educational and/or behavioral problems, compared with their normal-hearing peers. Limited data exist about the effect of UHL on acquisition of speech and language skills. Objective To review the current literature about the impact UHL has on the development of speech and language and educational achievement. Data Source MEDLINE search between 1966 and June 1, 2003, using the medical subject heading "hearing loss," combined with the textword "unilateral." Study Selection Studies were limited to those written in English, reporting speech-language and/or educational results in children. Data Extraction Articles were read with attention to study design, population, recruitment of subjects, and outcomes measured. Data Synthesis Problems in school included a 22{\%} to 35{\%} rate of repeating at least one grade, and 12{\%} to 41{\%} receiving additional educational assistance. Speech and language delays have been reported in some but not all studies. Conclusions School-age children with UHL appear to have increased rates of grade failures, need for additional educational assistance, and perceived behavioral issues in the classroom. Speech and language delays may occur in some children with UHL, but it is unclear if children "catch up" as they grow older. Research into this area is necessary to clarify these issues and to determine whether interventions may prevent potential problems.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the prevalence of minimal sensorineural hearing loss (MSHL) in school-age children and to assess the relationship of MSHL to educational performance and functional status. DESIGN: To determine prevalence, a single-staged sampling frame of all schools in the district was created for 3rd, 6th, and 9th grades. Schools were selected with probability proportional to size in each grade group. The final study sample was 1218 children. To assess the association of MSHL with educational performance, children identified with MSHL were assigned as cases into a subsequent case-control study. Scores of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (4th Edition) (CTBS/4) then were compared between children with MSHL and children with normal hearing. School teachers completed the Screening Instrument for Targeting Education Risk (SIFTER) and the Revised Behavior Problem Checklist for a subsample of children with MSHL and their normally hearing counterparts. Finally, data on grade retention for a sample of children with MSHL were obtained from school records and compared with school district norm data. To assess the relationship between MSHL and functional status, test scores of all children with MSHL and all children with normal hearing in grades 6 and 9 were compared on the COOP Adolescent Chart Method (COOP), a screening tool for functional status. RESULTS: MSHL was exhibited by 5.4{\%} of the study sample. The prevalence of all types of hearing impairment was 11.3{\%}. Third grade children with MSHL exhibited significantly lower scores than normally hearing controls on a series of subtests of the CTBS/4; however, no differences were noted at the 6th and 9th grade levels. The SIFTER results revealed that children with MSHL scored poorer on the communication subtest than normal-hearing controls. Thirty-seven percent of the children with MSHL failed at least one grade. Finally, children with MSHL exhibited significantly greater dysfunction than children with normal hearing on several subtests of the COOP including behavior, energy, stress, social support, and self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hearing loss in the schools almost doubles when children with MSHL are included. This large, education-based study shows clinically important associations between MSHL and school behavior and performance. Children with MSHL experienced more difficulty than normally hearing children on a series of educational and functional test measures. Although additional research is necessary, results suggest the need for audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and educators to evaluate carefully our identification and management approaches with this population. Better efforts to manage these children could result in meaningful improvement in their educational progress and psychosocial well-being.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between age of enrollment in intervention and language outcomes at 5 years of age in a group of deaf and hard-of-hearing children. METHOD: Vocabulary skills at 5 years of age were examined in a group of 112 children with hearing loss who were enrolled at various ages in a comprehensive intervention program. Verbal reasoning skills were explored in a subgroup of 80 of these children. Participants were evaluated using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and a criterion-referenced measure, the Preschool Language Assessment Instrument, administered individually by professionals skilled in assessing children with hearing loss. A rating scale was developed to characterize the level of family involvement in the intervention program for children in the study. RESULTS: A statistically significant negative correlation was found between age of enrollment and language outcomes at 5 years of age. Children who were enrolled earliest (eg, by 11 months of age) demonstrated significantly better vocabulary and verbal reasoning skills at 5 years of age than did later-enrolled children. Regardless of degree of hearing loss, early-enrolled children achieved scores on these measures that approximated those of their hearing peers. In an attempt to understand the relationships among performance and factors, such as age of enrollment, family involvement, degree of hearing loss, and nonverbal intelligence, multiple regression models were applied to the data. The analyses revealed that only 2 of these factors explained a significant amount of the variance in language scores obtained at 5 years of age: family involvement and age of enrollment. Surprisingly, family involvement explained the most variance after controlling for the influence of the other factors (r =.615; F change = 58.70), underscoring the importance of this variable. Age of enrollment also contributed significantly to explained variance after accounting for the other variables in the regression (r = -.452; F change = 19.24). Importantly, there were interactions between the factors of family involvement and age of enrollment that influenced outcomes. Early enrollment was of benefit to children across all levels of family involvement. However, the most successful children in this study were those with high levels of family involvement who were enrolled early in intervention services. Late-identified children whose families were described as limited or average in involvement scored {\textgreater}2 standard deviations below their hearing peers at 5 years of age. Even in the best of circumstances (eg, early enrollment paired with high levels of family involvement), the children in this study scored within the low average range in abstract verbal reasoning compared with hearing peers, reflecting qualitative language differences in these groups of children. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the findings of Yoshinaga-Itano et al,(1) significantly better language scores were associated with early enrollment in intervention. High levels of family involvement correlated with positive language outcomes, and, conversely, limited family involvement was associated with significant child language delays at 5 years of age, especially when enrollment in intervention was late. The results suggest that success is achieved when early identification is paired with early interventions that actively involve families.},

Unfortunately, until more effective newborn hearing screening equipment and procedures were developed in the late 1980s, it was not practical to implement programs for identifying hearing loss during the first few months of life. This paper reviews the activities implemented by the federal government in the last 15 years to promote more effective Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) programs, and summarizes legislation passed by states related to universal newborn hearing screening. In surveys conducted in 1998 and 2001, State EHDI Coordinators were asked to rate the degree to which various issues were obstacles to implementing effective EHDI programs. The most serious obstacles are the shortage of qualified pediatric audiologists, inadequate reimbursement for screening and diagnosis, and lack of knowledge among primary health care providers about EHDI issues. Opposition to EHDI programs by hospital administrators was rated substantially lower in 2001 than in 1998. State EHDI Coordinators were also surveyed about how well their EHDI program is addressing issues related to screening, diagnosis, early intervention, linkages to medical home providers, tracking and data management, and family support programs. Although substantial progress has been made, many gaps remain with current EHDI programs.},

Rates of IEPs remained {\textgreater}50{\%} throughout, and rates of speech therapy were consistently about 20{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Children with UHL demonstrated improvement in oral language and verbal intelligence quota scores over time, but not improvements in school performance. Parents and teachers reported persistent behavioral problems and academic weaknesses or areas of concern in about 25{\%}. The provision of IEPs for children with UHL, and acknowledging UHL as a hearing disability, may be an effective intervention to improve language skills over time.},

abstract = {Recent reports suggest that early onset, severe unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL) in children may be associated with significant deficits in auditory and psycholinguistic skills and school performance. This report reviews a consecutive series of 324 children and adolescents (202 males, 122 females) with documented USNHL evaluated at the Boys Town National Research Hospital. The left ear was affected in 168 (52{\%}) and the right ear in 156 (48{\%}). Based on speech frequency threshold averages (i.e., 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz), the losses were classified by severity as follows: borderline, 43 (13{\%}); mild, 51 (16{\%}); moderate, 40 (12{\%}); severe, 19 (6{\%}); profound, 31 (10{\%}), and anacusic, 50 (15{\%}). The remaining 90 children (28{\%}) had high frequency losses (i.e., above 2000 Hz). The mean and median age of diagnosis were 8.78 years and 7.75 years. Temporal bone imaging studies, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), and vestibular evaluations were performed on selected cases. Etiology was uncertain in 34.8{\%} of cases, while hereditary factors (12.6{\%}), head trauma (10.8{\%}), and perinatal risk factors (10.7{\%}) were the most commonly identified etiologies. Thirty-one percent of the children had scholastic or behavioral problems in school. A concerted effort aimed at early identification and intervention in cases of USNHL is warranted.},

The past two decades have seen the gradual introduction of universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) programmes coupled with early intervention programmes. We review studies that have capitalised on the advent of newborn hearing screening to assess the impact of early identification of PCHI on language outcomes in deaf children. The research supports the conclusion that, in children with PCHI, newborn hearing screening and early identification lead to beneficial effects on language development, with the most consistent evidence provided for links between early identification of PCHI and positive language outcomes. Future research needs to encompass a wider range of outcomes and to assess the impact of UNHS in adolescents and young adults.},

In view of potential concerns about their psychosocial adjustment, our aim was to assess the effect of implants on the adolescents' psychosocial functioning among a group of 57 deaf adolescents with and without CIs, using published and validated measures completed by the adolescents themselves, their parents, and teachers. Adolescents with CI tended to be more hearing acculturated, whereas those without CI tended to be more Deaf acculturated. Despite some differences in background characteristics between the two groups, there were no differences between them on the psychosocial variables assessed in this study, regardless of the reporting sources. Rather than having a direct effect on the psychosocial outcomes assessed in this study, it is through the mediating effect of acculturation and school setting that CI status exerts an influence over many of this study's outcomes.

Several of the procedures and modifications to apparatus have been developed specifically for use with deaf children. Clinical data are presented from 160 hearing-impaired children (age range three--16 years). Eighteen percent of their ears were found to contain excessive cerumen and to require ear canal irrigation. The incidence of abnormal tympanograms was high for young children but decreased with increasing age. A simple auditory speech perception test designed for use with both severely and profoundly deaf children is described, which provides for evaluation of a child's ability to recognize words, categorize them into stress patterns, or both. The children's word recognition and word categorization scores were found to relate to their audiometric averages. The overall test battery is easy to administer and also is efficient, in that considerable audiologic information can be obtained quickly.},

Babies with hearing loss who are identified early and provided with appropriate intervention develop better language, cognitive, and social skills. As a result of improvements in screening equipment and procedures, newborn hearing screening programs have expanded rapidly in recent years, and almost 90{\%} of all newborns are now screened for hearing loss before leaving the hospital. Because 50{\%} or more of congenital hearing loss is due to genetic causes, providers of genetic services should play an increasingly important role in newborn hearing screening, diagnostic, and intervention services. For this to happen, parents, public health officials, and primary health care providers need to become better informed about the benefits of genetic services for children with hearing loss and their families. Providers of genetic services also need to become better informed about the current status of Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) programs and how they can contribute to continued improvement of these programs.},

Objective To determine the prevalence of pediatric readmissions and the magnitude of variation in pediatric readmission rates across hospitals. Design, Setting, and Patients We analyzed 568 845 admissions at 72 children's hospitals between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions Case Mix Comparative data set. We estimated hierarchical regression models for 30-day readmission rates by hospital, accounting for age and Chronic Condition Indicators. Hospitals with adjusted readmission rates that were 1 SD above and below the mean were defined as having “high” and “low” rates, respectively. Main Outcome Measures Thirty-day unplanned readmissions following admission for any diagnosis and for the 10 admission diagnoses with the highest readmission prevalence. Planned readmissions were identified with procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Results The 30-day unadjusted readmission rate for all hospitalized children was 6.5{\%} (n=36 734). Adjusted rates were 28.6{\%} greater in hospitals with high vs low readmission rates (7.2{\%} [95{\%} CI, 7.1{\%}-7.2{\%}] vs 5.6{\%} [95{\%} CI, 5.6{\%}-5.6{\%}]). For the 10 admission diagnoses with the highest readmission prevalence, the adjusted rates were 17.0{\%} to 66.0{\%} greater in hospitals with high vs low readmission rates. For example, sickle cell rates were 20.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 20.0{\%}-20.3{\%}) vs 12.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 12.6{\%}- 12.8{\%}) in high vs low hospitals, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients admitted to acute care pediatric hospitals, the rate of unplanned readmissions at 30 days was 6.5{\%}. There was significant variability in readmission rates across conditions and hospitals. These data may be useful for hospitals' quality improvement efforts.},

Data were drawn from the 2002 Swiss Multicenter Adolescent Survey on Health database, a nationally representative survey of 7548 adolescents in postmandatory school aged 16 to 20 years. There were 760 subjects who reported a chronic illness and/or a disability. The comparison group consisted of 6493 subjects who answered negatively to both questions. We defined 8 risk behaviors: daily smoking, alcohol misuse, current cannabis use, current use of any other illegal drug, early sexual debut, eating disorder, violent acts, and antisocial acts. We analyzed each behavior and the sum of behaviors, controlling for age, gender, academic track, parents{\textquoteright} education level, depression, and health status. Results are given as adjusted odds ratios using the comparison group as the reference category.RESULTS. Youth with a chronic condition were more likely to smoke daily, to be current cannabis users, and to have performed violent or antisocial acts. Youth with a chronic condition were also more likely to report 3 or >=4 risk behaviors.CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that having a chronic condition carries additional risks for engaging in health risk behaviors and emphasize the importance of health risk screening and preventive counseling for young people in general and among those suffering from chronic conditions in particular.},

abstract = {Background: Hearing loss affects health and quality of life. The prevalence of hearing loss may be growing because of an aging population and increasing noise exposure. However, accurate national estimates of hearing loss prevalence based on recent objective criteria are lacking. Methods: We determined hearing loss prevalence among US adults and evaluated differences by demographic characteristics and known risk factors for hearing loss (smoking, noise exposure, and cardiovascular risks). A national cross-sectional survey with audiometric testing was performed. Participants were 5742 US adults aged 20 to 69 years who participated in the audiometric component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. The main outcome measure was 25-dB or higher hearing loss at speech frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) and at high frequencies (3, 4, and 6 kHz). Results: In 2003-2004, 16.1{\%} of US adults (29 million Americans) had speech-frequency hearing loss. In the youngest age group (20-29 years), 8.5{\%} exhibited hearing loss, and the prevalence seems to be growing among this age group. Odds of hearing loss were 5.5-fold higher in men vs women and 70{\%} lower in black subjects vs white subjects. Increases in hearing loss prevalence occurred earlier among participants with smoking, noise exposure, and cardiovascular risks. Conclusions: Hearing loss is more prevalent among US adults than previously reported. The prevalence of US hearing loss differs across racial/ethnic groups, and our data demonstrate associations with risk factors identified in prior smaller-cohort studies'. Our findings also suggest that hearing loss prevention (through modifiable risk factor reduction) and screening should begin in young adulthood.},

abstract = {Context.— Hearing loss in children influences the development of communication and behavioral skills, but few studies in the United States have used pure-tone audiometry to derive hearing loss prevalence estimates for children.Objective.— To describe the prevalence of hearing loss among US children by sociodemographic characteristics, reported hearing loss, and audiometric screening factors.Design.— National population-based cross-sectional survey with an in-person interview and audiometric testing at 0.5 to 8 kHz.Setting/Participants.— A total of 6166 children aged 6 to 19 years completed audiometry in the mobile examination center of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 1988 and 1994.Main Outcome Measure.— Hearing loss, defined as audiometric threshold values of at least 16-dB hearing level based on a low or high pure-tone average.Results.— A total of 14.9{\%} of children had low-frequency or high-frequency hearing loss of at least 16-dB hearing level, 7.1{\%} had low-frequency hearing loss of at least 16-dB hearing level, and 12.7{\%} had high-frequency hearing loss of at least 16-dB hearing level. Most hearing loss was unilateral and slight in severity (16- to 25-dB hearing level). Of those with measured hearing loss, 10.8{\%} were reported to have current hearing loss during the interview.Conclusions.— This analysis indicates that 14.9{\%} of US children have low-frequency or high-frequency hearing loss of at least 16-dB hearing level in 1 or both ears. Among children in elementary, middle, and high school, audiometric screening should include low-frequency and high-frequency testing to detect hearing loss.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Large-scale epidemiological studies have often used self-report to estimate prevalence of age-related hearing loss. However, few large population-based studies have validated self-report against measured hearing loss. Our study aimed to assess the performance of a single question and a brief hearing handicap questionnaire in identifying individuals with hearing loss, against the gold standard of pure-tone audiometry. METHODS: We examined 2015 residents, aged 55-99 years, living in the west of Sydney, Australia, who participated in the Blue Mountains Hearing Study during 1997-1999. Audiologists administered a comprehensive questionnaire, including the question: 'Do you feel you have a hearing loss?' The Shortened Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly (HHIE-S) was also administered during the hearing examination, which included pure-tone audiometry. The single question and HHIE-S were compared with measured losses at levels {\textgreater}25, {\textgreater}40 and {\textgreater}60 decibels hearing level (dBHL) to indicate mild, moderate and marked hearing impairment, for pure-tone averages (PTA) of responses to 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz. RESULTS: The single question yielded reasonable sensitivity and specificity for hearing impairment, and was minimally affected by age and gender. HHIE-S scores {\textgreater}8 had lower sensitivity but higher specificity and positive predictive value. The HHIE-S performed slightly better in younger than older subjects and performed better for moderate hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In this older population with a high prevalence of hearing loss (39.4{\%}), both a question about hearing and the HHIE-S appeared sufficiently sensitive and specific to provide reasonable estimates of hearing loss prevalence. Both could be recommended for use in epidemiological studies that aim to assess the magnitude of the burden caused by age-related sensory impairment but cannot measure hearing loss by audiometry.},

The philosophy of symbolic interactionism guided this study. Understanding the adolescents' experiences included exploring adolescents' perspectives of the following: (1) what it is like to have a chronic illness, and (2) how they deal with having a chronic illness. A sample of 23 adolescents, 13 to 16 years of age, and diagnosed with either diabetes, asthma, arthritis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis participated. Data collection involved the adolescents participating in open-ended interviews. The constant comparative method was used to analyze all data from the interviews. The findings revealed that having a chronic illness made life more difficult for the adolescents. Adolescents experience extra effort, restriction, pain, and additional worries because of having a chronic illness. However, adolescents also clearly had ways to help them deal with their illness. These strategies and recommendations for practice and future research are discussed.},

Analyses showed that individuals with acute illnesses scored higher on general self-efficacy than individuals with chronic illnesses. No differences between illness groups were observed in perceived control, although severity of illness ratings were found to be negatively related to perceived control. People with chronic illnesses were more likely to use a combination of emotional preoccupation, instrumental and distraction coping strategies, whereas people with acute illnesses used palliative coping strategies to a greater extent. Self-efficacy was found to be negatively related to emotional preoccupation coping, regardless of illness category (i.e., acute vs chronic). Results are discussed in terms of the importance of each of the variables for the two categories of illnesses. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Attempted to: (1) describe peer interaction of adolescents with a chronic illness in comparison with norms of healthy adolescents; (2) examine the relationship of peer interaction with the illness characteristics functional limitations and pain. Peer interaction of 98 adolescents with a chronic illness was assessed with measures of social activities (Child Behavior Check List), social self-esteem (Dutch version of Self Perception Profile for Adolescents), self-reported social skills (Scale of Interpersonal Behaviour for Adolescents, SIG-A) and social anxiety. Results showed that diagnosis is related to social activities, but not to other aspects of peer interaction. Chronically ill girls had a lower level of social activities compared to healthy Ss. In addition, girls with cystic fibrosis displayed more assertive behaviour than healthy girls, while chronically ill boys displayed less inadequate social skills than healthy boys. Functional limitations were not associated with peer interaction. However, pain was associated with restricted social activities in boys. It was concluded that in general, chronically ill adolescents were well adjusted socially and that functional limitations and pain do not seem to be risk factors for social adjustment problems.

A brief review of the literature on organizational humour is followed by a more detailed examination of the illuminating analysis by Willis of school/shop-floor counter-culture. Although his research provides a strong basis for the case study presented below, it is criticized for a tendency to romanticize working-class culture, humour and informal opposition.$\backslash$nIn contrast, by means of an empirical analysis of joking forms in the components division of a lorry producing factory, the paper then explores not only the collective elements, but also the internal divisions and contradictions that characterize shop-floor relations. By critically questioning the workers' manifest search to secure a highly masculine sense of identity, the paper is able to highlight a 'darker side' of shop-floor culture, which underpins and ultimately undermines the creative humour and collectivity found in the factory.},

METHODS: Data were from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2005 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey collected from a representative sample of public and private high school students (grades 9 through 12) in the United States. RESULTS: Significantly more students with physical disabilities or long-term health problems than without described their health as fair or poor and reported being in a physical fight, being forced to have sexual intercourse, feeling sad or hopeless, seriously considering and attempting suicide, cigarette smoking, using alcohol and marijuana, engaging in sexual activity, using computers 3 or more hours per day, and being overweight (for all, p  .05). For none of the health risk behaviors analyzed were the rates significantly lower among students with physical disabilities or longterm health problems than among other students. CONCLUSIONS: Young people who live with physical disabilities or long-term health problems may be at greater risk for poor health outcomes. Public health and school health programs, with guidance from health care providers, need to work with these adolescents and their families to develop and implement appropriate interventions, with particular emphasis on promoting mental health.},

Studies have shown that pediatric asthma is associated with psychiatric disorders, but the specificity and temporality of these relations is not well known. This study examined the associations between any and specific psychiatric disorders and both childhood asthma and other childhood chronic illnesses. The study used the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders data, a four-site, community-based study of 1,285 pairs of youths and caretakers. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC 2.3). Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders was also used to assess individual characteristics, parental reports of asthma, and other chronic illnesses. Asthma and 'other' chronic illnesses were associated with different psychiatric disorders. In particular, having a history of asthma was associated with having an anxiety disorder, after adjustment for potential confounding, but was not associated with having an affective disorder. Having a chronic illness other than asthma or cancer was associated with having any affective disorder and dysthymia but not anxiety disorder. These results call for more mechanistic research that explores the specific relations between childhood anxiety disorder and asthma and between affective disorder and other pediatric chronic illnesses.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that children with both social and biomedical risk factors are more likely to be in poorer health and utilize more health services than those with either type of risk alone. Methods: Variables were identified using the 1998 National Health Interview Survey and tested here on 2002 data. Dependent variables were health (poorer health rating) and service use (hospitalization or greater than 2 emergency services). High social risk was defined as greater than 2 risk factors (parental education less than high school, family income {\textless}200{\%} of federal poverty level, and non-2-parent family). High biomedical risk was defined as having a chronic condition or birth weight {\textless}2500 grams. Results: Children with either high social or biomedical risk were significantly more likely to be in poorer health (odds ratio [OR] 3.1-3.4) and to have higher utilization (OR 1.7-2.1) than children at low risk on both dimensions. Children with high risk on both dimensions were significantly more likely to be in poorer health (OR 7.8-7.9) and have higher utilization (OR 3.5-3.7) on both social and biomedical risks and those children rated high risk on either dimension alone. Overall, social risk was as powerful as biomedical risk in these models and added substantially to biomedical risk. Findings were stable using different cut points for social risk and health ratings, and different definitions of chronic condition. Conclusions: These findings have implications for health care planners and insurers in estimating the burdens on clinicians and potential costs of delivering care to those with high social risks.

abstract = {Purpose: Although it is common for adolescents to experiment with several health-risk behaviors before reaching adulthood, little is known about the co-occurrence of these behaviors. The purposes of this study were to determine the co-occurrence of specific health-risk behaviors among a nationally representative sample of adolescents, and to examine whether the distribution of multiple risk behaviors varies by age, sex, and school enrollment status. Methods: This study analyzed survey data from a United States national probability sample (n = 10,645) of youth aged 12-21 years. Survey items measuring current seat belt use, weapon carrying, tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use, and sexual behavior were included in the analysis. Results: The majority of adolescents aged 12-17 years did not engage in multiple health-risk behaviors. However, the prevalence of multiple risk behaviors increased dramatically with age. While only 1 in 12 adolescents aged 12-13 years engaged in two or more of these behaviors, one- third of those aged 14-17 years and half of the college-aged youth (18-21 years) did so. Male respondents and out-of-school youth aged 14-17 years were more likely to engage in multiple health-risk behaviors than were other respondents. Conclusions: These results suggest that the likelihood that adolescents engage in multiple health-risk behaviors is related to age and that many adolescents engage in these behaviors serially rather than at the same time.},

To address these issues, we test hypotheses, derived from GST, about the relationships among strain, negative emotions, and deviant coping by analyzing data from a nationally representative sample of African American adults. Ordinary least squares regression results generally support our hypotheses. First, fully mediating the effects of strain on deviant coping, negative emotions have consistently significant effects on deviance, regardless of whether we use composite or separate measures of inner- and outer-directed emotions and deviance. Interestingly, as hypothesized, the same-directed effects of negative emotions on deviant coping are larger than the opposite-directed ones. Second, while self-esteem and self-efficacy as conditioning factors generally fail to receive empirical support, religiosity is found to significantly buffer the effects of negative emotions on deviance. Implications of our findings for further development of GST are discussed},

Both boys and girls with CCs were more likely to report few protective factors and co-occurrence of risk behaviours. The adjOR for clustered health risk behaviours was 1.6 (1.0-2.5) in youths with CCs and ≥4 protective factors and 6.3 (3.6-10.9) in youths with CCs and 0-3 protective factors, as compared to healthy peers with ≥4 protective factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Adolescents with CCs reported fewer protective factors and more risk behaviours than their healthy peers. The vulnerability of adolescents with CCs and few protective factors is important to acknowledge. Professionals should provide stronger protection for these adolescents, to prevent risky behaviour.},

abstract = {PROBLEM: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nREPORTING PERIOD COVERED: September 2012-December 2013.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 104 health-risk behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2013 national survey, 42 state surveys, and 21 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results from the 2013 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.4{\%} of high school students nationwide among the 64.7{\%} who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 34.9{\%} had drunk alcohol, and 23.4{\%} had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 14.8{\%} had been electronically bullied, 19.6{\%} had been bullied on school property, and 8.0{\%} had attempted suicide. Many high school students nationwide are engaged in sexual risk behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. Nearly half (46.8{\%}) of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 34.0{\%} had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 15.0{\%} had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 59.1{\%} had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2013 national YRBS also indicate many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 15.7{\%} of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 8.8{\%} had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.0{\%} of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100{\%} fruit juices and 6.6{\%} had not eaten vegetables. More than one-third (41.3{\%}) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health-risk behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-risk behaviors has decreased (e.g., physical fighting, current cigarette use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other health-risk behaviors has not changed (e.g., suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, having ever used marijuana, and having drunk alcohol or used drugs before last sexual intercourse) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concern and obesity and overweight).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health-risk behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 20 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.},

abstract = {Peer relations and close friendships play important roles in youngsters' emotional development and take on special significance when a child or adolescent has a chronic disease. This article reviews the key ways that peer relations have been examined in youth with chronic pediatric conditions and specifically focuses on (1) the role of peers and close friends as a source of support, (2) friends' influence on treatment adherence, and (3) peers' and friends' impact on health-promoting and health-risk behaviors. In general, youngsters with chronic conditions do not have more problems in their peer relations than other youth, although children with medical conditions that are stigmatizing or that involve the central nervous system (CNS) may encounter peer difficulties. Social support from friends and classmates appears to facilitate youngsters' disease adaptation and may help with the lifestyle aspects of treatment regimens. Adolescent peer-crowd affiliations (e.g., "brains," "jocks") that are linked with health-promoting behaviors may prove beneficial to youngsters' disease management and health. The findings underscore the need for helping children and adolescents disclose their medical condition to peers in positive ways and for including youngsters' close friends in the treatment process and in school-reentry programs after extended medical care. Additional research is needed to develop strategies for incorporating youngsters' peers and friends into the medical management of youth with chronic pediatric conditions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess sexual behaviors, sexual orientation, pregnancy, and abuse history among adolescents with and without chronic conditions. METHODS: Analyses were based on a statewide survey of 36,284 young people in the 7th through 12th grades for analytic purposes; subsets were defined using a specialized cohort design including adolescents with visible and nonvisible conditions plus controls. Principle outcome measures included self report of ever having sexual intercourse, age of sexual debut, reasons for not having intercourse, ever causing or having a pregnancy, ever having a sexually transmitted disease (STD), contraceptive use and reasons for their nonuse, history of sexual abuse, and sexual orientation. RESULTS: No differences were evident between adolescents with and without chronic conditions in the proportion ever having intercourse, age of sexual debut, pregnancy involvement, patterns of contraceptive use, or sexual orientation. No differences were evident among girls or boys with visible compared with invisible conditions. A significantly greater proportion of girls and boys with invisible conditions than controls reported a history of sexual abuse. More index boys than controls reported ever having an STD, whereas more girls with visible conditions than controls reported this. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with chronic conditions are at least as sexually involved as their peers, and significantly more likely to have been sexually abused. Visibility of chronic conditions does not appear to affect the sexual behaviors of adolescents. The need for comprehensive sexuality education in this population is high, and discussion of sexuality, contraception and abuse must be part of standard psychosocial assessment and anticipatory guidance for all teenagers, including those with chronic conditions.},

METHODS: Data were collected from 215 patients, aged 14 +/- 2 years with a mean disease duration of 7 +/- 5 years. The control group was comprised of 464 healthy adolescents recruited among high school students. Each patient completed an anonymous confidential questionnaire to determine the prevalence of sexual behaviour, alcohol and tobacco consumption, illicit drug use, and, among patients with diabetes and frequency of mismanagement related to diabetes care. RESULTS: Compared with controls, subjects with diabetes showed a similar rate of sexual intercourse among males and lower rates among females (34.8{\%} vs 35.5{\%}, p NS and 29.4{\%} vs 41.4{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05, respectively). Males in the diabetes group reported a higher rate of tobacco use, whereas females showed similar or higher rates of use for every illicit drug studied. Among patients with diabetes, those who are engaged in risky behaviour showed a higher rate of treatment mismanagement (76{\%} vs 34{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: Adolescents with T1DM are as likely as their healthy peers to engage in risky behaviour, indicating the potential benefit of anticipatory guidance concerning glycaemic control and increased risk of acute and chronic complications.},

abstract = {Living with a chronic condition (CC) in adolescence has been historically considered protective for risk behaviours. However, research from the last decade suggest that when compared with healthy peers, adolescents living with a chronic condition can engage in risky behaviours in a similar if not higher rate than their counterparts living with out a CC. This study aims to characterize and evaluate the impact of 1) living with a chronic condition (CC), and 2) how the perception of living with a CC affects school participation, and its association with risk/protective behaviours (drunkenness, physical fight, sadness and self-harm). For this purpose 4 groups were identified: adolescents with mostly healthy behaviours, adolescents with mostly risk behaviours, adolescents with mostly risk-internalizing behaviours and adolescents with mostly risk-externalizing behaviours. A large sample was included in this study, composed by 3494 Portuguese adolescents with an average age of 15 years, who participated in the Portuguese Survey of Health Behaviour in School-aged Children/WHO (HBSC). Main results show that adolescents living with a CC have more risk-internalizing behaviours when compared to adolescents without CC, who present more healthy behaviors. Furthermore, adolescents that report that having a CC affects school participation show more risky behaviours than those not affected by a CC who present more healthy behaviours. Boys with a CC show more healthy behaviours, and those who feel that the CC affects school participation present more risky behaviours. On the other hand, girls with a CC have more risk-internalizing behaviours and less healthy behaviours It is important to point out that adolescents living with a CC represent a vulnerable group, and may engage in experimental/risky behaviours as likely as their non CC peers. Thus, potential benefits can arise from reinforcing interventions within protective contexts (family/peers/school setting). Health/education professionals, more than considering risk behaviours as dangerous in themselves, should offer adolescents with a CC an opportunity to reflect on their own decisions. Educational programs would benefit from looking at risk behaviors more from an experimentation perspective, focusing on constructive ways to help adolescents with CC to proceed into adulthood in a more appropriate developmental way.},

abstract = {Purpose: Although studies of General Strain Theory (GST) typically include measures of physical health in multi-item indices of strain, no work has investigated the independent influence of physical health on criminal offending. The current research explores the relationship between physical health and criminal offending among low-income women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Methods: Using data from the Welfare, Children, and Families (WCF) project, criminal behavior is predicted over two years with measures of physical health, depression, anxiety, competing strain, and relevant background factors. Results: Poorer physical health at baseline and declines in physical health increase the odds of offending onset among previous non-offenders and reduce the odds of decreased offending among previous offenders. In offending onset models, higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline and increases in these symptoms partially mediate the effect of poorer baseline health and fully mediate the effect of the loss of physical health. In decreased offending models, increases in anxiety and depression fully mediate the effect of poorer baseline health and partially mediate the effect of the loss of physical health. Conclusions: The data suggest that poor health and declines in physical health influence both offending onset and offending escalation directly and indirectly through increases in anxiety and depression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A growing body of literature indicates that adolescents with chronic conditions are as likely, or more likely, to take risky behaviours than their healthy peers. The objective of this research was to assess whether adolescents with chronic illness in Catalonia differ from their healthy peers in risk-taking behaviour. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Catalonia Adolescent Health database, a survey including a random school-based sample of 6952 young people, aged 14-19 years. The index group (IG) included 665 adolescents (450 females) reporting several chronic conditions. The comparison group (CG) comprised 6287 healthy adolescents (3306 females). Personal, family and school-related variables were analysed to ensure comparability between groups. Sexual behaviour, drug use (tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and synthetic drugs) and perception of drug use among peers and in school were compared. Analysis was carried out separately by gender. chi-square, Fisher's and Student's tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of chronic conditions was 9.6{\%}, with females showing a higher prevalence than males. The IG showed similar or higher rates of sexual intercourse and risky sexual behaviour. For most studied drugs, IG males reported slightly lower rates of use than CG males, while IG females showed higher rates for every drug studied. No differences were found in the perceptions of drug use among peers or in their school. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous research, chronically ill adolescents in our sample are as likely, or more likely, to take risky behaviours than their healthy counterparts and should receive the same anticipatory guidance.},

abstract = {Purpose This study examined the association of individual, family, and school-level characteristics with age of sexual initiation (ASI) and focused specifically on school context as a moderator of known predictors of ASI. Methods Data are from Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 10,596). Predictors include grade point average, physical development, attitudes about sex, likelihood of higher education, alcohol use, delinquency, family structure, parents' education level, childhood abuse, maternal approval of sex, parental monitoring, and parent-child relationship quality. School-level predictors are averages of adolescents' attitudes about sex and likelihood of higher education and parents' education. Hierarchical linear models run separately by sex were used to predict ASI. Results When school-level attitudes about sex are more favorable, both boys and girls report younger ASI, and school mean parental education attainment moderates the influence of individual adolescents' attitudes about sex on ASI. More of the predictors are significant for girls than boys, whereas perception of maternal and peer approval of sexual activity are the most salient predictors of younger ASI for boys. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of school context for understanding adolescents' motivations for early ASI. Findings support the need for school-wide prevention interventions that engage adolescents, peers, and parents in addressing attitudes about early sex.},

abstract = {Substance use is a threat to the health and well-being of youths, their families, and society as well. The literature shows that social interactions with peers, parents, and community may have an impact on adolescents' behavior. Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health of 2007, this study investigated the impact of social capital on youth behavior. The results show that peer influence is the strongest among the three significant predictors of substance use. While peer influence is positively correlated with substance use, family attachment and youth activities have a negative relationship with substance use. Findings demonstrate that there is a relationship between youth substance use and different aspects of social capital. By integrating different perspectives in social capital and substance use, this study successfully demonstrates how social capital can be utilized as a policy and intervention tool.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Research consistently shows a negative view of individuals with obesity in the general public and in various other settings. Stigma and discrimination can be considered chronic stressors, as these factors have a profound impact on the psychological well-being of the affected individuals. This article proposes a framework that entails a mediation of the adverse effects of discrimination and stigmatization on mental well-being through elevated psychological risk factors that are not unique to weight but that could affect overweight and normal-weight individuals alike.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted to assess the prevalence of psychological risk factors, such as self-esteem and coping, in individuals with obesity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Forty-six articles were assessed and included for detailed analysis. The number of studies on these topics is limited to certain dimensions of psychological processes. The best evaluated association of obesity and psychosocial aspects is seen for self-esteem. Most studies establish a negative association of weight and self-esteem in children and adults. All studies with mediation analysis find a positive mediation through psychological risk factors on mental health outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This review shows that elevated psychological risk factors are existent in individuals with obesity and that they may be a mediator between weight discrimination and pathopsychological outcomes.},

We review research on the role of child and adolescent coping with stress as an important feature of the process of adaptation to illness. Recent findings support a control-based model of coping that includes primary control or active coping (efforts to act on the source of stress or one's emotions), secondary control or accommodative coping (efforts to adapt to the source of stress), and disengagement or passive coping (efforts to avoid or deny the stressor). Evidence suggests the efficacy of secondary control coping in successful adaptation to chronic illness in children and adolescents, disengagement coping is associated with poorer adjustment, and findings for primary control coping are mixed. Avenues for future research are highlighted.},

abstract = {Limited research is available that explains complex contextual and interactive effects of microsystems such as family relationships, peer networks, and placebased influences have on urban adolescent substance use. We contend that research into these complex processes is improved by integrating psychological, social, and geographic data to better understand urban adolescent substance use involvement. Accordingly, we tested a longitudinal, 3-way moderation model to determine if the direct effect of teen–parent relationships on substance use involvement is moderated by peer network characteristics, which in turn is moderated by the risk and protective attributes within urban adolescents' activity spaces, among a sample of 248 adolescents. Results revealed that peer networks moderate the effects of relations with parents on substance use involvement for those adolescents with higher levels of risk attributes within their activity space, but not for those who spend time in locations with less risk. Thus, the teen–parent relationship interacts with peer network characteristics, for those urban adolescents whose activity space is constituted within high-risk environments. We conclude that peer networks have important interactive effects with family relationships that influence substance use, and that this is particularly salient for young adolescents who are exposed to risky environments. This finding underscores the importance of continued study into the interrelations among microsystems of urban adolescents, and provides further support that substance use is a social practice that is constituted within the unique geography of young adolescents' lives.},

Pretest and posttest measures, designed to detect the relative influence of stress, social networks, social competencies, and community resources on levels of students' usage, were completed at the beginning and end of the school year. The parameters of the model, estimated using LISREL7, indicated that the pathway from family characteristics to usage and from assertion to usage were significant. The paths from the remaining hypothesized variables were not significant. Implications for the design of prevention programs that facilitate youths' resiliency are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adolescents face peak risks for onset and intensification of alcohol and marijuana use. However, we know little about these behaviors and their associations with knowledge or treatment adherence among chronically ill youth, a medically vulnerable group. METHODS: Cross-sectional assessment of consented youth ages 9 to 18 years receiving care for asthma/cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by using a self-administered online tool. Prevalence and correlates of risk behaviors and associations with knowledge and treatment adherence were estimated using descriptive statistics and logistic regression, controlling for demographics, mental health, and the multiclinic sampling frame. RESULTS: Of 403 consented youth (75.8{\%} response), 51.6{\%} were girls, 75.1{\%} were white, and average age was 15.6 years. Of high school youth, 36.5{\%} and 12.7{\%} reported past-year alcohol use and binge drinking, respectively; 20{\%} reported past-year marijuana use. Among high school youth, 53.1{\%} and 37.2{\%} answered correctly that alcohol can interfere with their medications and laboratory tests; youth answering incorrectly were 8.53 and 4.46 times more likely to drink and binge drink, respectively (P values {\textless}.001). Thirty-two percent and 8.3{\%} of high school youth reported regularly forgetting or skipping their medications in the past 30 days; compared with past-year nondrinking youth, drinkers were 1.79 and 1.61 times as likely to report regularly missing or skipping medications (P values {\textless}.05). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and marijuana use are common among youth with chronic medical conditions. Alcohol use is associated with treatment nonadherence. Education and preventive interventions are warranted to ameliorate risk.},

BACKGROUND: Young people with chronic illness have the same developmental issues as those who are healthy. However, development can be disrupted by treatment and repeated hospitalisation. While the physical consequences of chronic illness on development have been established, the subjective personal experience is less known. DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Electronic databases and hand searches were made of the literature published between January 1990-September 2007. Literature was eligible for inclusion if it involved adolescents between 10-19 years, and published in English and used qualitative methods of data collection. Methodological quality was assessed using the criteria described by Cesario et al. [Journal of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Neonatal Nursing 31 (2002) 31]. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty studies were identified involving young people with a wide variety of chronic illnesses. The study quality was variable, however, generally the majority was assessed as being good or fair. Seven common themes were found between the identified studies: developing and maintaining friendships; being normal/getting on with life; the importance of family; attitude to treatment; experiences of school; relationship with the healthcare professionals; and the future. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: As there was commonality in themes between studies strategies to lessen the burden of chronic illness during adolescence do not necessarily need to be disease specific. Nurses need to focus on treating the young person rather than their illness.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of risk behaviors and to measure the extent of co-occurrence of these behaviors in chronically ill and healthy adolescents. METHODS: Data were drawn from the 2002 Swiss Multicenter Adolescent Survey on Health database, a nationally representative survey of 7548 adolescents in postmandatory school aged 16 to 20 years. There were 760 subjects who reported a chronic illness and/or a disability. The comparison group consisted of 6493 subjects who answered negatively to both questions. We defined 8 risk behaviors: daily smoking, alcohol misuse, current cannabis use, current use of any other illegal drug, early sexual debut, eating disorder, violent acts, and antisocial acts. We analyzed each behavior and the sum of behaviors, controlling for age, gender, academic track, parents' education level, depression, and health status. Results are given as adjusted odds ratios using the comparison group as the reference category. RESULTS: Youth with a chronic condition were more likely to smoke daily, to be current cannabis users, and to have performed violent or antisocial acts. Youth with a chronic condition were also more likely to report 3 or {\textgreater}or=4 risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that having a chronic condition carries additional risks for engaging in health risk behaviors and emphasize the importance of health risk screening and preventive counseling for young people in general and among those suffering from chronic conditions in particular.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study provides nationally representative prevalence estimates of internalizing mental health symptoms among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and identifies significant covariates of these symptoms by using multivariate regression. Internalizing symptoms include feeling anxious and depressed. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a nationally representative, parent-reported, cross-sectional survey of 40 465 CSHCN. The presence of internalizing mental health symptoms was assessed by using 2 binary items capturing whether a child had or experienced difficulty with depression, anxiety, disordered eating, or other emotional problems. The odds of experiencing internalizing symptoms were assessed by using multivariate regression, controlling for sociodemographic, health-related, and burden-related covariates. RESULTS: A total of 31.9{\%} of CSHCN 3 to 17 years of age experienced internalizing mental health symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression showed internalizing symptoms to be strongly associated with female gender, older age, and frequent activity limitations, as well as externalizing mental health symptoms and conditions with behavioral components. Children with behavior problems had 6 times the odds of internalizing symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.95 [95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 5.30-6.69]), whereas children with autism spectrum disorder had 3 times the odds (aOR: 3.00 [95{\%} CI: 2.39-3.77]). Increased odds of symptoms also were associated with frequent headaches (aOR: 1.76 [95{\%} CI: 1.45-2.13]) and chronic pain (aOR: 1.46 [95{\%} CI: 1.22-1.75]). Odds of symptoms were greater for children living in households that experienced employment changes or financial burdens resulting from the children's needs. CONCLUSIONS: Internalizing mental health symptoms are common among CSHCN. Findings may help caregivers focus screening and prevention efforts for high-risk groups in this heterogeneous population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use meta-analytic techniques to compare self-concept between children and adolescents (abbreviated to youth) with a chronic illness versus healthy controls, and to examine methodological influences on effect sizes. METHOD: Databases were searched for asthma, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, and juvenile arthritis. Inclusion criteria were: 1) original research studies in English; 2) youth {\textless}18 years; 3) the inclusion of self-reported self-concept; and 4) data available to estimate effect sizes. Study quality was assessed with a modified Quality Index. Effect sizes were calculated as Hedges' g using a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 60 studies were analyzed. On average, youth with a chronic illness had compromised self-concept, d = -0.17 [-0.27, -0.07]. However, type of control group exerted a moderating influence that resulted in discrepant findings. Studies based on normative data reported higher self-concept in youth with a chronic illness, d = 0.27 [0.06, 0.47], whereas studies that recruited healthy controls reported lower self-concept in youth with a chronic illness, d = -0.25 [-0.34, -0.15]. CONCLUSIONS: Self-concept is compromised in youth with a chronic illness; however, the effect size may be underestimated because of methodological weaknesses and systematic biases in existing studies. Future research should avoid the use of normative data and employ rigorous methods to ensure representative sampling and control of confounding variables to better appreciate the impact of chronic illness on youths' self-concept.},

abstract = {Context One in 7 US children and adolescents is obese, yet little is known about their health-related quality of life (QOL). Objective To examine the health-related QOL of obese children and adolescents compared with children and adolescents who are healthy or those diagnosed as having cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study of 106 children and adolescents (57 males) between the ages of 5 and 18 years (mean [SD], 12.1 [3] years), who had been referred to an academic children's hospital for evaluation of obesity between January and June 2002. Children and adolescents had a mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) of 34.7 (9.3) and BMI z score of 2.6 (0.5). Main Outcome Measures Child self-report and parent proxy report using a pediatric QOL inventory generic core scale (range, 0-100). The inventory was administered by an interviewer for children aged 5 through 7 years. Scores were compared with previously published scores for healthy children and adolescents and children and adolescents diagnosed as having cancer. Results Compared with healthy children and adolescents, obese children and adolescents reported significantly (P{\textless}.001) lower health-related QOL in all domains (mean [SD] total score, 67 [16.3] for obese children and adolescents; 83 [14.8] for healthy children and adolescents). Obese children and adolescents were more likely to have impaired health-related QOL than healthy children and adolescents (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.4-8.7) and were similar to children and adolescents diagnosed as having cancer (OR, 1.3; 95{\%} CI, 0.8-2.3). Children and adolescents with obstructive sleep apnea reported a significantly lower health-related QOL total score (mean [SD], 53.8 [13.3]) than obese children and adolescents without obstructive sleep apnea (mean [SD], 67.9 [16.2]). For parent proxy report, the child or adolescent's BMI z score was significantly inversely correlated with total score (r=-0.246; P=.01), physical functioning (r=-0.263; P{\textless}.01), social functioning (r=-0.347; P{\textless}.001), and psychosocial functioning (r=-0.209; P=.03). Conclusions Severely obese children and adolescents have lower health-related QOL than children and adolescents who are healthy and similar QOL as those diagnosed as having cancer. Physicians, parents, and teachers need to be informed of the risk for impaired health-related QOL among obese children and adolescents to target interventions that could enhance health outcomes.},

abstract = {This study examines the way coping styles and locus of control contribute to the prediction of psychosocial adjustment in adolescents with a chronic illness. Psychosocial adjustment of 84 adolescents aged 13-16 years with a chronic illness was assessed with measures of social adjustment, global self-esteem and behavior problems. Linear regressions were performed with demographic factors (age and gender) and stress-processing factors (coping style and locus of control) as predictor variables. Results indicated that coping styles were related to most aspects of social adjustment. The coping styles 'seeking social support' and 'confrontation' were important predictors for positive social adjustment; the coping style 'depression' was a predictor for poor adjustment, viz, low social self-esteem and high social anxiety. Avoidance and locus of control were not strongly associated with psychosocial adjustment. Clinical implications of these findings were discussed in terms of preventive interventions for adolescents with a chronic illness.},

Their likelihood of experiencing adverse health outcomes because of these behaviors may be beyond that experienced by their healthier peer group. Pediatric providers are responsible for appropriately counseling these patients about healthy lifestyles. This review provides some background regarding these health risks among adolescents and young adults with SHCN with particular focus on three populations: childhood cancer survivors, congenital heart disease patients, and those with intellectual disability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Young adults and adolescents with chronic medical conditions are as likely - and perhaps more likely - to engage in health risk behaviors. However, these behaviors are not fully addressed by primary care providers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Pediatric providers are encouraged to ask adolescents and young adults with SHCN about their understanding of, and engagement in, health risk behaviors. A multidisciplinary approach to encourage a healthy lifestyle within this population may have significant health benefits.},

abstract = {Background Depression and anxiety are common in medical patients and are associated with diminished health status and increased health care utilization. This article presents a quantitative review and synthesis of studies correlating medical patients' treatment noncompliance with their anxiety and depression. Methods Research on patient adherence catalogued on MEDLINE and PsychLit from January 1, 1968, through March 31, 1998, was examined, and studies were included in this review if they measured patient compliance and depression or anxiety (with n{\textgreater}10); involved a medical regimen recommended by a nonpsychiatrist physician to a patient not being treated for anxiety, depression, or a psychiatric illness; and measured the relationship between patient compliance and patient anxiety and/or depression (or provided data to calculate it). Results Twelve articles about depression and 13 about anxiety met the inclusion criteria. The associations between anxiety and noncompliance were variable, and their averages were small and nonsignificant. The relationship between depression and noncompliance, however, was substantial and significant, with an odds ratio of 3.03 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.96-4.89). Conclusions Compared with nondepressed patients, the odds are 3 times greater that depressed patients will be noncompliant with medical treatment recommendations. Recommendations for future research include attention to causal inferences and exploration of mechanisms to explain the effects. Evidence of strong covariation of depression and medical noncompliance suggests the importance of recognizing depression as a risk factor for poor outcomes among patients who might not be adhering to medical advice.},

abstract = {Efforts to identify children with ongoing health conditions generally rely on lists of diagnoses. However, there has been a growing trend to use a noncategorical, or generic, approach in which such children are identified by the consequences of their condition. Recent legislation and the Supreme Court decision in Sullivan v Zebley adopt this broader concept and mandate that a noncategorical approach be used in determining eligibility for services and benefits. Traditional condition lists are less desirable because (1) every disorder to which children are subject cannot be included (2) diagnoses may be applied inconsistently by clinicians and across settings, (3) condition labels alone do not convey the extent of morbidity for individuals, (4) there is a bias toward identifying only those children who have access to the medical care system, and (5) there is often a gap between emergence of symptoms or consequences and diagnosis. We developed a noncategorical framework for identifying children with ongoing health conditions that responds to the federal mandate and uses consequences of disorders, rather than diagnostic labels. It can be applled to meet the objectives of services, research, policy, reimbursement, or program eligibility; is consistent across diagnoses; is descriptive of the impact of morbidity; is adaptable to meet specific purposes; and can be modified by imposing different severity levels. Our screening tool will soon be available for practical use.},

METHODS: The meta-analysis included 57 studies comparing levels of social competence in children with chronic illness to those of children without chronic illness. A random effects model was used to calculate overall effect, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses. RESULTS: Overall, the meta-analysis calculated 90 unique outcomes, producing a summary standardized mean difference of d = -0.44, 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) -0.52 to -0.36 indicating a medium overall effect for decrease social competence. Chronic illness, measure, and informant moderated social competence outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of chronic illness on youth varied by individual child factors (e.g., gender, chronic illness type) and by measurement features such as informant and measure type. The current study demonstrates a need for further research of the assessment of social competence and has implications for the development of social skills programs for children with chronic illness.},

Research-identified correlates of suicide in youth include depression, academic failure, loss of friends, social isolation, and substance abuse, among others. This review focuses on the potential link between chronic illness in adolescents and increased suicide risk. Research suggests that chronic illness is a risk factor for depression in adolescents that may induce suicide ideation and attempts; however, this risk may be increased even more in young adulthood if the underlying causes of depression are not resolved. This risk needs to be considered against the research data noting an increase in suicide attempts and completions, in each decade of life from adolescence into adulthood. Although more research is clearly needed, it can be concluded that suicide risks are seen in adolescents with chronic illness and all of these young people should be screened for depression and other risk factors for suicide on a regular basis.},

abstract = {Purpose: Spiritual coping is an important determinant of adjustment in youth with chronic illness, but the mechanisms through which it affects outcomes have not been elucidated. It is also unknown whether the role of spiritual coping varies by age or disease group. This study evaluated whether general cognitive attributions explain the effects of spiritual coping on internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents with cystic fibrosis and diabetes and whether these relationships vary by age or disease group. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, adolescents (N = 128; M = 14.7 yrs) diagnosed with cystic fibrosis or diabetes completed measures of spiritual coping and attributional style. Adolescents and their caregivers reported on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Results: Overall, positive spiritual coping was associated with fewer internalizing and externalizing problems. Negative spiritual coping was related to more externalizing problems, and for adolescents with cystic fibrosis only, also internalizing problems. Optimistic attributions mediated the effects of positive spiritual coping among adolescents with diabetes. The results did not vary by age. Conclusions: An optimistic attribution style may help explain the effects of positive, but not negative, spiritual coping on adjustment of youth with diabetes. Youth with progressive, life-threatening illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis, may be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of negative spiritual coping. Future research should examine whether addressing spiritual concerns and promoting optimistic attributions improves adolescents' emotional and behavioral functioning. ?? 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Data were obtained from the 1995 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) conducted by 20 different states and cities in the U.S. These data were combined with state data on cigarette taxes, vending machine laws, beer taxes, and family planning clinic availability. A model of teenage risk taking suggested that the three risk behaviors were codetermined by a common latent risk-taking propensity. We used a structural equation model (SEM) accounting for this shared latent propensity to estimate the extent of participation in terms of frequency of smoking, drinking, and the number of sex partners. Results. Estimating simultaneous equations for all three risk behaviors was statistically more efficient than equation-by-equation estimates of each behavior. Estimates indicated significant deterrent effects of beer taxes, vending machine restrictions, and increased density of family planning clinics on teenage risk behavior. Conclusions. State policies, such as taxes on beer, and restrictions on location of cigarette vending machines, and placement of family planning clinics influence adolescents' behavior. Because there is interrelationship between these behaviors, systems estimators, can offer improved estimates of these effects. ?? 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc.

At least 12{\%} of adolescents live with a chronic condition. Some conditions are characterised by increasing incidence (eg, diabetes) or improving survival rates (eg, cystic fibrosis), while others are concerning because of differentially poorer outcomes in adolescents in comparison to both children and adults (eg cancer). Growing evidence suggests that young people with chronic conditions are doubly disadvantaged-engaging in risky behaviours to at least similar if not higher rates as healthy peers, while having the potential for greater adverse health outcomes from these behaviours. In addition to efforts at improving survival, in order to improve their life chances, we need to better understand how the social and emotional outcomes of young people with a chronic disea se can be improved, and better support young people's emerging capacity for self-management. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objectives. —To determine (1) the number and proportion of Americans living with chronic conditions, and (2) the magnitude of their costs, including direct costs (annual personal health expenditures) and indirect costs to society (lost productivity due to chronic conditions and premature death). Design. —Analysis of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey for prevalence and direct health care costs; indirect costs based on the 1990 National Health Interview Survey and Vital Statistics of the United States. Setting. —US population. Participants. —For the estimate of prevalence and direct costs, the National Medical Expenditure Survey sample of persons who reported health conditions associated with (1) use of health services or supplies or (2) periods of disability. Interventions. —None. Main Outcome Measures. —The number of persons with chronic conditions, their annual direct health care costs, and indirect costs from lost productivity and premature deaths. Results. —In 1987, 90 million Americans were living with chronic conditions, 39 million of whom were living with more than 1 chronic condition. Over 45{\%} of non-institutionalized Americans have 1 or more chronic conditions and their direct health care costs account for three fourths of US health care expenditures. Total costs projected to 1990 for people with chronic conditions amounted to {\$}659 billion—{\$}425 billion for direct health care costs and {\$}234 billion in indirect costs. Conclusions. —The prevalence and costs of chronic conditions as a whole have rarely been estimated. Because the number of persons with limitations due to chronic conditions is more regularly reported in the literature, the total prevalence of chronic conditions has perhaps been minimized. The majority of persons with chronic conditions are not disabled, nor are they elderly. Chronic conditions affect all ages. Because persons with chronic conditions have greater health needs at any age, their costs are disproportionately high.},

abstract = {The need for a widely applicable definition of chronic conditions for research, policy, and program development has led to an extensive review of the development of such definitions, the considerations involved in their use, and some recommendations for a new approach. This paper examines some of the methodologic and conceptual issues related to defining and classifying chronic conditions and describes some consequences resulting from decisions made about these issues. While most examples are taken from child health applications, the basic concepts apply to all age groups. The dominant method for identifying and classifying children as having a chronic condition has relied on the presence of an individual health condition of lengthy duration. This condition-specific or "categorical" approach has increasingly seemed neither pragmatically nor conceptually sound. Thus, the development of a "generic" approach, which focuses on elements that are shared by many conditions, children, and families, is recommended. Such a definition might reflect the child's functional status or ongoing use of medical services over a specified time period. In addition, it is suggested that conditions be classified based on the experience of individual children, thus emphasizing the tremendous variability in expression of seemingly similar conditions.},

abstract = {Behavioural, cognitive, and affective aspects of social functioning of 107 children with a chronic illness were studied. The aim of the study was twofold: (1) to describe peer interaction of children with a chronic illness in comparison with normative data of healthy children; (2) to examine whether peer interaction was related to the illness characteristics physical restrictions and pain. Peer interaction was assessed with measures of social activities (CBCL), parent-reported social skills (CABS), child-reported social skills (MESSY), social self-esteem (SPPC), and social anxiety (SASK). Results showed no differences between diagnosis groups, suggesting that the social consequences of chronic illness are not diagnosis specific. Compared with healthy norms, chronically ill children reported less aggressive behaviour. The parent-report measures suggested a similar trend. Children with chronic illness also tended to display more submissive behaviour than healthy norms, as perceived by their parents. With regard to illness characteristics, both physical restrictions and pain were associated with restricted social activities, but not with other measures of social peer interaction. Children who display submissive behaviour and children who are restricted in their social activities should receive extra attention because they are especially vulnerable for problems in their social development.},

abstract = {Major depression affects 3 to 5 percent of children and adolescents. Depression negatively impacts growth and devel- opment, school performance, and peer or family relationships and may lead to suicide. Biomedical and psychosocial risk factors include a family history of depression, female sex, childhood abuse or neglect, stressful life events, and chronic illness. Diagnostic criteria for depression in children and adolescents are essentially the same as those for adults; however, symptom expression may vary with developmental stage, and some children and adolescents may have difficulty identifying and describing internal mood states. Safe and effective treatment requires accurate diagno- sis, suicide risk assessment, and use of evidence-based therapies. Current literature supports use of cognitive behavior therapy for mild to moderate childhood depression. If cognitive behavior therapy is unavailable, an antidepressant may be considered. Antidepressants, preferably in conjunction with cognitive behavior therapy, may be considered for severe depression. Tricyclic antidepressants generally are ineffective and may have serious adverse effects. Evidence for the effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is limited. Fluoxetine is approved for the treatment of depression in children eight to 17 years of age. All antidepressants have a black box warning because of the risk of suicidal behavior. If an antidepressant is warranted, the risk/benefit ratio should be evaluated, the parent or guardian should be educated about the risks, and the patient should be monitored closely (i.e., weekly for the first month and every other week during the second month) for treatment-emergent suicidality. Before an antidepressant is initiated, a safety plan should be in place. This includes an agreement with the patient and the family that the patient will be kept safe and will contact a responsible adult if suicidal urges are too strong, and assurance of the availability of the treating physician or proxy 24 hours a day to manage emergencies.

abstract = {Researchers in the field of juvenile justice have long been interested in understanding the factors that may lead a juvenile to engage in delinquent behavior. Prevention strategies in the field of juvenile justice have recently adopted a public health approach to combating delinquency, targeting risk factors for delinquency. The article defines risk factors and examines some of the major risk factors linked to juvenile delinquency and violence. Risk factors are defined as characteristics or variables that, if present in any given youth, increase the chance that they will engage in delinquent behavior. Risk factors for delinquency fall into three broad categories: individual, social, and community. Individual factors include psychological, behavioral, and mental characteristics; social factors include family and peer influences; and community factors include school and neighborhood characteristics. By studying these risk factors, researchers and practitioners are able to enhance prevention programs by targeting the very factors or characteristics that are known to lead to delinquency. This public health strategy offers a promising approach to the prevention of juvenile delinquency in at-risk youth. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study sought the answer to three questions: 1. Is having an intimate partner associated with the level of delinquency? 2. Does the quality of the relationship with an intimate partner, operationalised as partner support, predict the level of delinquency? 3. Does a relationship with an intimate partner or age moderate the association between parental support and delinquency? METHOD: Data from a three-wave, six-year longitudinal study of 1302 adolescents and young adults, aged 12-23 at wave 1, were used. RESULTS: 1. Univariate latent growth curve analysis showed that, as predicted, having an intimate partner does not lead to less criminality among young adults over the age of 20. We found no support for the hypothesis among the group of 12- to 20-year-old adolescents, since the group of mid-adolescents who consistently have a partner is more criminal than the other groups. 2. Our findings show that partner support is negatively related to criminality in both 12- to 20-year-olds and 21- to 23-year-olds. The longitudinal effect of partner support is also uni-directional: partner support T1 certainly has an impact on criminality T3, but the reverse is not true. In both groups the influence of partner support is also greater than that of parental support. 3. Having an intimate partner moderates the association between parental support and delinquency, but in an age-specific manner. Parental support has no bearing on criminality when adolescents and young adults continuously have an intimate partner. Parental support does, however, cause a reduction in the level of criminality in adolescents and young adults who have never had a partner and adolescents who only have a partner at time 3. CONCLUSIONS: We interpret our results in terms of shifts in the relational system: if an adolescent finds a partner, that partner takes over the role of the parents in reducing criminality; if not, the parents remain important in doing so.},

abstract = {Importance Health care–associated infections (HAIs) account for a large proportion of the harms caused by health care and are associated with high costs. Better evaluation of the costs of these infections could help providers and payers to justify investing in prevention. Objective To estimate costs associated with the most significant and targetable HAIs. Data Sources For estimation of attributable costs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed for the years 1986 through April 2013. For HAI incidence estimates, we used the National Healthcare Safety Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Study Selection Studies performed outside the United States were excluded. Inclusion criteria included a robust method of comparison using a matched control group or an appropriate regression strategy, generalizable populations typical of inpatient wards and critical care units, methodologic consistency with CDC definitions, and soundness of handling economic outcomes. Data Extraction and Synthesis Three review cycles were completed, with the final iteration carried out from July 2011 to April 2013. Selected publications underwent a secondary review by the research team. Main Outcomes and Measures Costs, inflated to 2012 US dollars. Results Using Monte Carlo simulation, we generated point estimates and 95{\%} CIs for attributable costs and length of hospital stay. On a per-case basis, central line–associated bloodstream infections were found to be the most costly HAIs at {\$}45 814 (95{\%} CI, {\$}30 919-{\$}65 245), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia at {\$}40 144 (95{\%} CI, {\$}36 286-{\$}44 220), surgical site infections at {\$}20 785 (95{\%} CI, {\$}18 902-{\$}22 667), Clostridium difficile infection at {\$}11 285 (95{\%} CI, {\$}9118-{\$}13 574), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections at {\$}896 (95{\%} CI, {\$}603-{\$}1189). The total annual costs for the 5 major infections were {\$}9.8 billion (95{\%} CI, {\$}8.3-{\$}11.5 billion), with surgical site infections contributing the most to overall costs (33.7{\%} of the total), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (31.6{\%}), central line–associated bloodstream infections (18.9{\%}), C difficile infections (15.4{\%}), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections ({\textless}1{\%}). Conclusions and Relevance While quality improvement initiatives have decreased HAI incidence and costs, much more remains to be done. As hospitals realize savings from prevention of these complications under payment reforms, they may be more likely to invest in such strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize hospital costs of pediatric intensive care and to determine which demographic and disease characteristics are associated with cost. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A 20-bed pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in an urban university-affiliated teaching children's hospital. PATIENTS: All children (n = 1,376) admitted to the multidisciplinary PICU during the fiscal year 1994. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographics, diagnoses, organ failure, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score, length of stay (LOS), and outcome were recorded. All hospital charges were obtained. The actual hospital costs were calculated by two separate methods. First, we converted the itemized patient charges into costs, using corresponding cost-to-charge ratios for each charge. In addition, we examined all direct and indirect expenses for the PICU. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to determine the correlates to cost. The study population was similar to that of other studies of pediatric intensive care. The PICU was 86{\%} efficient. The total cost for PICU care was {\$}16,983,323. Average cost per admission was {\$}12,342 +/- {\$}22,313, and average cost per patient day was {\$}2,264 +/- {\$}868. The cost because of the PICU location (room cost) was 52.1{\%} of all costs, and cost of laboratory studies was 18.3{\%}. Respiratory therapy, pharmacy services, and radiology each accounted for between 6{\%} and 8{\%}. Total cost was most closely related to LOS, but severity of illness (Pediatric Risk of Mortality), diagnosis, and organ failure were also significant. Severity of illness was the most important factor in determining the variation in daily costs. Increased severity of illness was associated with higher laboratory and diagnostic study costs. We found little difference in the PICU room cost when calculated by adding direct and indirect expenses, compared with that obtained by using the cost-to-charge ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The maintenance of the specialty location and its personnel is the most costly component of pediatric intensive care. The strongest correlate with total cost for pediatric intensive care is LOS, but if costs are normalized for LOS, severity of illness best explains cost variation among patients. These data may serve as the basis for additional studies of resource allocation and consumption in the future.},

One objective of statistical analysis is to describe the marginal expectation of the outcome variable as a function of the covariates while accounting for the correlation among the repeated observations for a given subject. This paper proposes a unifying approach to such analysis for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. A class of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for the regression parameters is proposed. The equations are extensions of those used in quasi-likelihood (Wedderburn, 1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447) methods. The GEEs have solutions which are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian even when the time dependence is misspecified as we often expect. A consistent variance estimate is presented. We illustrate the use of the GEE approach with longitudinal data from a study of the effect of mothers' stress on children's morbidity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyze the evolving role, patterns of use, and costs of critical care medicine in the United States from 2000 to 2005. DESIGN: Retrospective study of data from the Hospital Cost Report Information System (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Baltimore, Maryland). SETTING: Nonfederal, acute care hospitals with critical care medicine beds in the United States. SUBJECTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We analyzed hospital and critical care medicine beds, bed types, days, occupancy rates, payer mix (Medicare and Medicaid), and costs. Critical care medicine costs were compared with national cost indexes. Between 2000 and 2005, the total number of U.S. hospitals with critical care medicine beds decreased by 12.2{\%} (from 3,586 to 3,150). Although the number of hospital beds decreased by 4.2{\%} (from 655,785 to 628,409), both hospital days and occupancy rates increased by 5.1{\%} (from 145.1 to 152.5 million) and 13.7{\%} (from 59{\%} to 67{\%}), respectively. Critical care medicine beds increased by 6.5{\%} (from 88,252 to 93,955), days by 10.6{\%} (from 21.0 to 23.2 million), and occupancy rates by 4.5{\%} (from 65{\%} to 68{\%}). The majority (90{\%}) of critical care medicine beds were classified as intensive care, premature/neonatal, and coronary care unit beds. The percentage of critical care medicine days used by Medicare decreased by 3.8{\%} (from 37.9{\%} to 36.5{\%}) compared with an increase of 15.5{\%} (from 14.5{\%} to 16.8{\%}) by Medicaid. From 2000 to 2005, critical care medicine costs per day increased by 30.4{\%} (from {\$}2698 to {\$}3518). Although annual critical care medicine costs increased by 44.2{\%} (from {\$}56.6 to {\$}81.7 billion), the proportion of hospital costs and national health expenditures allocated to critical care medicine decreased by 1.6{\%} and 1.8{\%}, respectively. However, the proportion of the gross domestic product used by critical care medicine increased by 13.7{\%}. In 2005, critical care medicine costs represented 13.4{\%} of hospital costs, 4.1{\%} of national health expenditures, and 0.66{\%} of the gross domestic product. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care medicine continues to grow in a shrinking U.S. hospital system. The critical care medicine payer mix is evolving, with Medicaid increasing in its percentage of critical care medicine use. Critical care medicine is more cost controlled than other healthcare indexes, but is still using an increasing percentage of the gross domestic product. Our updated and comprehensive critical care medicine use and cost analysis provides a contemporary benchmark for the strategic planning of critical care medicine services within the U.S. healthcare system.},

abstract = {Acutely ill patients are commonly found on general hospital wards; some of these are patients who have been recently discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU). These patients may require a higher level of care than other ward patients and, due to the acuity of their illness, are at risk of readmission to ICU. Research has indicated that patients readmitted to ICU have mortality rates up to six times higher than those not readmitted and are eleven times more likely to die in hospital. Numerous studies have retrospectively examined these readmissions but, despite this, there is still no clear indication of why ICU readmissions occur or what the common characteristics of readmitted patients are. This literature review examines the published studies on patients who have been readmitted to ICU. Further research is needed to explore why readmissions to ICU occur and the type of patient who is at greatest risk for readmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that outreach and early warning systems (EWS) are an integral part of a hospital wide systems approach to improve the early identification and management of deteriorating patients on general hospital wards, the widespread implementation of these interventions in practice is not based on robust research evidence. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the impact of critical care outreach services on hospital mortality rates. Secondary objectives included determining the effect of outreach services on intensive care unit (ICU) admission patterns, length of hospital stay and adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: The review authors searched the following electronic databases: EPOC Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and other Cochrane databases (all on The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1996-June week 3 2006), EMBASE (1974-week 26 2006), CINAHL (1982-July week 5 2006), First Search (1992-2005) and CAB Health (1990-July 2006); also reference lists of relevant articles, conference abstracts, and made contact with experts and critical care organisations for further information. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series designs (ITS) which measured hospital mortality, unanticipated ICU admissions, ICU readmissions, length of hospital stay and adverse events following implementation of outreach and EWS in a general hospital ward to identify deteriorating adult patients versus general hospital ward setting without outreach and EWS were included in the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently extracted data and two review authors assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity. Summary statistics and descriptive summaries of primary and secondary outcomes are presented for each study. MAIN RESULTS: Two cluster-randomised control trials were included: one randomised at hospital level (23 hospitals in Australia) and one at ward level (16 wards in the UK). The primary outcome in the Australian trial (a composite score comprising incidence of unexpected cardiac arrests, unexpected deaths and unplanned ICU admissions) showed no statistical significant difference between control and medical emergency team (MET) hospitals (adjusted P value 0.640; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.98; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.16). The UK-based trial found that outreach reduced in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.52; 95{\%} CI 0.32 to 0.85) compared with the control group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from this review highlights the diversity and poor methodological quality of most studies investigating outreach. The results of the two included studies showed either no evidence of the effectiveness of outreach or a reduction in overall mortality in patients receiving outreach. The lack of evidence on outreach requires further multi-site RCT's to determine potential effectiveness.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of, and potential risk factors for, unscheduled PICU readmission and assess for variability among PICUs within the United States.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN AND DATA SOURCE: This retrospective cohort study used 2005-2008 data from 73 PICUs in the Virtual PICU Systems database.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: Early (within 48 hr of PICU discharge) and late (later than 48 hr) unscheduled readmission rates were calculated. Hierarchical logistic regression, with a random intercept for site, was used to identify factors independently associated with early readmission. Significant random effects identified sites with an outlying risk of readmission, adjusting for patient and admission characteristics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: For 117,923 children meeting inclusion criteria, the unscheduled readmission rate was 3.7{\%} with 38{\%} (1.4{\%}) occurring early. Half of early readmissions had the same primary diagnosis as the first admission. Patients with late readmissions had a higher mortality (6.6{\%} vs 3.3{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001) and longer median total PICU length of stay (11 d vs 6 d, p {\textless} 0.0001) than those with early readmission. Patient characteristics strongly associated with increased risk of early readmission included the following: age {\textless} 6 months, acute respiratory and renal disease, and several underlying chronic conditions such as liver disease, bone marrow transplant, airway stenosis, and abnormal antidiuretic hormone balances. An initial PICU admission that was unscheduled, originated from the general floor, or with a discharge time between 4 PM and 8 AM was associated with higher risk of readmission. A quarter of sites were identified as potential high (16{\%}) or low (8{\%}) outliers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The rate of unscheduled PICU readmission was low but associated with worse outcomes. Patient and admission/discharge characteristics associated with increased risk of readmissions could be used to target high-risk populations or modifiable factors to improve outcome. Variation of risk among centers suggests room for improvement.},

Medical cancer patients were more severely ill on ICU admission in comparison with medical non-cancer patients, as reflected by higher needs for mechanical ventilation (50.8{\%} vs. 46.4{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001) and vasopressors within 24 hours after admission (41.5{\%} vs. 33.0{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV scores (88.1 vs. 67.5, p {\textless} 0.001) and a longer ICU stay (5.1 vs. 4.6 days, p {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, surgical cancer patients only displayed a modestly higher APACHE IV score on admission when compared with non-cancer surgical patients, whereas the other afore mentioned parameters were lower in the surgical cancer patients group. In-hospital mortality was almost twice as high in medical cancer patients (40.6{\%}) as in medical patients without cancer (23.7{\%}). In-hospital mortality of surgical cancer patients (17.4{\%}) was slightly higher than in patients without cancer (14.6{\%}). These data indicate that unplanned ICU admission is associated with a high mortality in patients with cancer when admitted for medical reasons.},

A total of 1259 consecutive total hip arthroplasties were reviewed; 89 patients experienced unplanned ICU admissions. Significant risk factors for ICU admission in univariate analysis were age greater than 75 years, revision surgery, obstructive sleep apnea, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min, prior myocardial infarction, American Society of Anesthesiologist class 3 or greater, use of vasopressors intraoperatively, and body mass index greater than 35 kg/m(2). With multiple regression, age greater than 75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.6 [1.2-5.6]), revision surgery (OR, 5.8 [3.0-11.4]), creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min (OR, 6.5 [2.5-16.3]), prior myocardial infarction (OR, 7.2 [2.0-25.4]), and body mass index greater than 35 kg/m(2) (OR, 2.9 [1.4-6.2]) were predictive of unplanned ICU admission.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to (1) conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify interventions that improve patient outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU); (2) evaluate potential measures of quality based on the impact, feasibility, variability, and the strength of evidence to support each measure and to categorize these measures as outcome, process, access, or complication measures; and (3) select a list of candidate quality measures that can be broadly applied to improve ICU care. Methods: We identified and independently reviewed all studies in Medline (1965-2000) and The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2001) that met the following criteria: design: observational studies, experimental trials, or systematic reviews; population: critically ill adults; and intervention: process or structure measure that was associated with improved patient outcomes: morbidity, mortality, complications, errors, costs, length of stay (LOS), and patient reported outcomes. Studies were grouped into categories by the type of outcome that was improved by the intervention. Potential quality measures were evaluated for: impact on morbidity, mortality, and costs; feasibility of the measure; and variability in the measure. We evaluated the strength of evidence for each intervention used to improve outcomes and using the Delphi method, assigned an overall recommendation for each quality measure. Results: A total of 3,014 citations were identified. Sixty-six studies that met selection criteria reported on a variety of interventions that were associated with improved patient outcomes. We identified 6 outcome measures: ICU mortality rate, ICU LOS greater than 7 days, average ICU LOS, average days on mechanical ventilation, suboptimal management of pain, and patient/family satisfaction; 6 process measures: effective assessment of pain, appropriate use of blood transfusions, prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia, appropriate sedation, appropriate peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, and appropriate deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis; 4 access measures: rate of delayed admissions, rate of delayed discharges, cancelled surgical cases, and emergency department by-pass hours; and 3 complication measures: rate of unplanned ICU readmission, rate of catheter-related blood stream infections, and rate of resistant infections. Conclusions: Further work is needed to create operational definitions and to pilot test the selected measures. The value of these measures will be determined by our ability to evaluate our current performance and implement interventions designed to improve the quality of ICU care.

abstract = {Background and aims: Unplanned admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with high mortality, having the highest incidence among patients who are emergency admissions to the hospital. This study was designed to identify factors associated with unplanned ICU admission in emergency admissions to hospital and develop an absolute risk tool to individualise the risk of an event during a hospital stay. Methods: Emergency department (ED) and in-patient hospital data from a large teaching hospital of consecutive admissions from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2007 aged over 14 years was included in this study. Patient data extracted from 126 826 emergency presentations admitted as in-patients consisted of demographic and clinical variables. Results: During an 11-year period 1582 incident unplanned ICU admissions occurred. Predictors of unplanned ICU admission included older age, being male, having a higher acuity triage category and a history of co-morbid conditions. Emergency department diagnostic groups associated with higher incidence of unplanned ICU admission included: sepsis, acute renal failure, lymphatic-hematopoietic tissue neoplasms, pneumonia, chronic-airways disease and bowel obstruction. The final model used to develop the nomogram had an ROC curve AUC of 0.7. Conclusion: This study identified factors associated with unplanned ICU admission and developed a nomogram to individualise risk prior to a patient being transferred from the ED. This nomogram provides clinicians the opportunity prior to transfer from the ED, to either (1) review the appropriateness of the ward level of planned transfer or (2) flag patients for follow-up on the general ward to assess for deterioration. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {An unplanned intensive care unit admission within 24 hours of a procedure with an anaesthetist in attendance (UIA) is a recommended clinical indicator It is designed to identify preventable iatrogenic complications. Often understood as a specific anaesthetic outcome, its value has been repeatedly questioned. Iatrogenic complications however often result from successive mishaps. In the specific context of an UIA these complications can be related both to anaesthesia and surgery. UIA is therefore probably more a global indicator of the safety of surgical care (anaesthetic and surgical) rather than a specific anaesthetic outcome. Its utility as such is however unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of UIA as a global measure of avoidable iatrogenic complications in surgical patients. Using computerised patient records and medical charts, all patients with an UIA over a study period of five years were identified. The proportion, cause and preventability of iatrogenic complications amongst these patients were assessed. A total of 188 UIA patients were identified by peer reviewers. Of these, 87{\%} to 92{\%} had a complication caused by anaesthesia and/or surgery. Anaesthesia was found to be responsible for 24{\%} to 31{\%} of iatrogenic complications. All other cases related to the combination of anaesthesia and surgery or surgery alone. Of these, 74{\%} to 92{\%} of complications were found to be preventable. Despite intrinsic limitations of the retrospective chart review method, UIA can be considered as a valuable tool to detect avoidable iatrogenic complications related to both surgical and anaesthetic care.},

abstract = {Background: Adolescents' technology use is generally associated with food cravings, but it is not clear whether specific types of technology elicit particular types of cravings or whether personal characteristics play a role in these associations. Objective: We examined whether momentary associations between four technology types (ie, television, video games, computer messaging, and phone messaging) and cravings for unhealthy snack foods and sweetened drinks were moderated by youths' sex, ethnicity, body mass index, and age. Methods: Urban adolescents (N=158) aged 14 to 17 years provided momentary information about their technology use and food cravings during the course of 1 week and completed survey reports of their personal characteristics. We used multilevel modeling to determine momentary associations and interactions. Results: Non-Hispanic adolescents showed stronger associations between television exposure and cravings for sweet snacks, salty snacks, and sweetened drinks.

Males showed stronger associations between video game use and salty snack cravings. Conclusions: As the public health field continues to monitor the effects of technology use on adolescents' eating and overall health, it will be important to determine the extent to which these groups are differentially affected by different forms of technology.},

abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Adverse events are unintended patient injuries or complications that arise from health care management resulting in death, disability or prolonged hospital stay. Adverse events that require critical care are a considerable financial burden to the health care system, but also their global impact on patients and society is probably underestimated. The objectives of this systematic review were to synthesize the best available evidence regarding the estimates of the incidence and preventability of adverse events that necessitate intensive care admission, to determine the type and consequences [mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and costs] of these adverse events.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: MEDLINE (from 1966 to present), EMBASE (from 1974 to present) and CENTRAL (version 1-2010) were searched for studies reporting on unplanned admissions on ICUs. Several other sources were searched for additional studies. Only quantitative studies that used chart review for the detection of adverse events requiring intensive care admission were considered for eligibility. For the purposes of this systematic review, ICUs were defined as specialized hospital facilities which provide continuous monitoring and intensive care for acutely ill patients. Studies that were published in the English, Dutch, German, French or Spanish language were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 27 studies were reviewed. Meta-analysis of the data was not appropriate because of methodological and statistical heterogeneity between studies; therefore, results are presented in a descriptive way. The percentage of surgical and medical adverse events that required ICU admission ranged from 1.1{\%} to 37.2{\%}. ICU readmissions varied from 0{\%} to 18.3{\%}. Preventability of the adverse events varied from 17{\%} to 76.5{\%}. Preventable adverse events are further synthesized by type of event. Consequences of the adverse events included a mean length of ICU stay that ranged from 1.5 days to 10.4 days for the patient's first stay in ICU and mortality percentages between 0{\%} and 58{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Adverse events are an important reason for (re)admission to the ICU and a considerable proportion of these are preventable. It was not possible to estimate an overall incidence and preventability rate of these events as we found considerable heterogeneity. To decrease adverse events that necessitate ICU admission, several systems are recommended such as early detection of patients with clinical instability on general wards and the implementation of rapid response teams. Step-down or intermediate care units could be a useful strategy for patients who require monitoring to avoid ICU readmissions. However, the effectiveness of such systems needs to be investigated.},

abstract = {AbstractObjectives To determine the main causes for unplanned admission of children to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) following anaesthesia in our centre. To compare the results with previous publications and propose a data sheet for the prospective collection of such information. Methods Inclusion criteria were any patient under 16 years who had an unplanned post-anaesthetic admission to the {\{}PICU{\}} from 1999 to 2010 in our university hospital. Age, {\{}ASA{\}} score, type of procedure, origin and causes of the incident(s) that prompted admission and time of the admission decision were recorded. Results Out of a total of 44,559 paediatric interventions performed under anaesthesia during the study period, 85 were followed with an unplanned admission to the PICU: 67{\%} of patients were younger than 5 years old. Their {\{}ASA{\}} status distribution from I to {\{}IV{\}} was 13{\%}, 47{\%}, 39{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively. The cause of admission was anaesthetic, surgical or mixed in 50{\%}, 37{\%} and 13{\%} of cases, respectively. The main causes of anaesthesia-related admission were respiratory or airway management problems (44{\%}) and cardiac catheterisation complications (29{\%}). In 62{\%}, the admission decision was taken in the operating room. Conclusion Unplanned admission to the {\{}PICU{\}} after general anaesthesia is a rare event. In our series, most cases were less than 5 years-old and were associated with at least one comorbidity. The main cause of admission was respiratory distress and the main type of procedure associated with admission was cardiac catheterisation.},

abstract = {Background: UK health services are under pressure to make cost savings while maintaining quality of care. Typically reducing the length of time patients stay in hospital and increasing bed occupancy are advocated to achieve service efficiency. Around 800,000 women give birth in the UK each year making maternity care a high volume, high cost service. Although average length of stay on the postnatal ward has fallen substantially over the years there is pressure to make still further reductions. This paper explores and discusses the possible cost savings of further reductions in length of stay, the consequences for postnatal services in the community, and the impact on quality of care. Method: We draw on a range of pre-existing data sources including, national level routinely collected data, workforce planning data and data from national surveys of women's experience. Simulation and a financial model were used to estimate excess demand, work intensity and bed occupancy to explore the quantitative, organisational consequences of reducing the length of stay. These data are discussed in relation to findings of national surveys to draw inferences about potential impacts on cost and quality of care. Discursive analysis: Reducing the length of time women spend in hospital after birth implies that staff and bed numbers can be reduced. However, the cost savings may be reduced if quality and access to services are maintained. Admission and discharge procedures are relatively fixed and involve high cost, trained staff time. Furthermore, it is important to retain a sufficient bed contingency capacity to ensure a reasonable level of service. If quality of care is maintained, staffing and bed capacity cannot be simply reduced proportionately: reducing average length of stay on a typical postnatal ward by six hours or 17 {\%} would reduce costs by just 8 {\%}. This might still be a significant saving over a high volume service however, earlier discharge results in more women and babies with significant care needs at home. Quality and safety of care would also require corresponding increases in community based postnatal care. Simply reducing staffing in proportion to the length of stay increases the workload for each staff member resulting in poorer quality of care and increased staff stress. Conclusions: Many policy debates, such as that about the length of postnatal hospital-stay, demand consideration of multiple dimensions. This paper demonstrates how diverse data sources and techniques can be integrated to provide a more holistic analysis. Our study suggests that while earlier discharge from the postnatal ward may achievable, it may not generate all of the anticipated cost savings. Some useful savings may be realised but if staff and bed capacity are simply reduced in proportion to the length of stay, care quality may be compromised.},

abstract = {Objectives To describe hospital utilization and costs associated with preterm or low birth weight births (preterm/LBW) by payer prior to implementation of the Affordable Care Act and to identify areas for improvement in the quality of care received among preterm/LBW infants. Methods Hospital utilization—defined as mean length of stay (LOS, days), secondary diagnoses for birth hospitalizations, primary diagnoses for rehospitalizations, and transfer status—and costs were described among preterm/LBW infants using the 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Results Approximately 9.1 {\%} of included hospitalizations (n = 4,167,900) were births among preterm/LBW infants; however, these birth hospitalizations accounted for 43.4 {\%} of total costs. Rehospitalizations of all infants occurred at a rate of 5.9 {\%} overall, but accounted for 22.6 {\%} of total costs. This pattern was observed across all payer types. The prevalence of rehospitalizations was nearly twice as high among preterm/LBW infants covered by Medicaid (7.6 {\%}) compared to commercially-insured infants (4.3 {\%}). Neonatal transfers were more common among preterm/LBW infants whose deliveries and hospitalizations were covered by Medicaid (7.3 {\%}) versus commercial insurance (6.5 {\%}). Uninsured/self-pay preterm and LBW infants died in-hospital during the first year of life at a rate of 91 per 1000 discharges—nearly three times higher than preterm and LBW infants covered by either Medicaid (37 per 1000) or commercial insurance (32 per 1000). Conclusions When comparing preterm/LBW infants whose births were covered by Medicaid and commercial insurance, there were few differences in length of hospital stays and costs. However, opportunities for improvement within Medicaid and CHIP exist with regard to reducing rehospitalizations and neonatal transfers.},

Off-service patients, transfer patients, and patients discharged before screening (usually admitted and discharged within 72 hours) were excluded. Data were collected on 173 patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: At-risk and not at-risk patients were compared for LOS, costs and reimbursement, and discharge placement (to home, to home with home health care services, or to another facility for further care). Two sample t tests and alpha survival analysis technique were used to compare continuous variables between the two study cohorts. Nonparametric tests were used for LOS and readmission data. chi 2 Tests were used for categoric variables. An alpha level of .05 was used throughout to determine statistical significance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Median LOS in the not-at-risk population (n = 56) was significantly greater than in the not-at-risk population (n = 117): 6 days (25th percentile = 4 days, 75th percentile = 8 days) vs 4 days (25th percentile = 3 days, 75th percentile = 7 days) (P {\textless} .01).

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Hearing loss (HL) in children can be deleterious to their speech and language development. The standard of practice has been early provision of hearing aids (HAs) to moderate these effects; however, there have been few empirical studies evaluating the effectiveness of this practice on speech and language development among children with mild-to-severe HL. OBJECTIVE To investigate the contributions of aided hearing and duration of HA use to speech and language outcomes in children with mild-to-severe HL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational cross-sectional design was used to examine the association of aided hearing levels and length of HA use with levels of speech and language outcomes. One hundred eighty 3- and 5-year-old children with HL were recruited through records of Universal Newborn Hearing Screening and referrals from clinical service providers in the general community in 6 US states. INTERVENTIONS All but 4 children had been fitted with HAs, and measures of aided hearing and the duration of HA use were obtained. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Standardized measures of speech and language ability were obtained. RESULTS Measures of the gain in hearing ability for speech provided by the HA were significantly correlated with levels of speech ($\rho$179 = 0.20; P = .008) and language: $\rho$155 = 0.21; P = .01) ability. These correlations were indicative of modest levels of association between aided hearing and speech and language outcomes. These benefits were found for children with mild and moderate-to-severe HL. In addition, the amount of benefit from aided hearing interacted with the duration of HA experience (Speech: F4,161 = 4.98; P {\textless} .001; Language: F4,138 = 2.91; P {\textless} .02). Longer duration of HA experience was most beneficial for children who had the best aided hearing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The degree of improved hearing provided by HAs was associated with better speech and language development in children. In addition, the duration of HA experience interacted with the aided hearing to influence outcomes. These results provide support for the provision of well-fitted HAs to children with HL. In particular, the findings support early HA fitting and HA provision to children with mild HL.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to help empirical economists think through when and how to weight the data used in estimation. We start by distinguishing two purposes of estimation: to estimate population descriptive statistics and to estimate causal effects. In the former type of research, weighting is called for when it is needed to make the analysis sample representative of the target population. In the latter type, the weighting issue is more nuanced. We discuss three distinct potential motives for weighting when estimating causal effects: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity, (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling, and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does. We recommend diagnostics for assessing the advisability of weighting, and we suggest methods for appropriate inference.},

The objective of this investigation was to assess whether auditory training in interrupted noise would improve speech recognition in noise for children with HI and perhaps enhance their utilization of glimpsing skills. A partially-repeated measures design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of seven 1-h sessions of auditory training in interrupted and continuous noise. Speech recognition scores in interrupted and continuous noise were obtained from pre-, post-, and 3 months post-training from 24 children with moderate-to-severe hearing loss. Children who participated in auditory training in interrupted noise demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in speech recognition compared to those who trained in continuous noise. Those who trained in interrupted noise demonstrated similar improvements in both noise conditions while those who trained in continuous noise only showed modest improvements in the interrupted noise condition. This study presents direct evidence that auditory training in interrupted noise can be beneficial in improving speech recognition in noise for children with HI.},

abstract = {A weighted logistic regression with careful selection of crash, vehicle, occupant and injury data and sequentially adjusting the covariants, was used to investigate the predictors of the odds of head/face and neck (HFN) injuries during rollovers. The results show that unbelted occupants have statistically significant higher HFN injury risks than belted occupants. Age, number of quarter-turns, rollover initiation type, maximum lateral deformation adjacent to the occupant, A-pillar and B-pillar deformation are significant predictors of HFN injury odds for belted occupants. Age, rollover leading side and windshield header deformation are significant predictors of HFN injury odds for unbelted occupants. The results also show that the significant predictors are different between head/face (HF) and neck injury odds, indicating the injury mechanisms of HF and neck injuries are different.},

abstract = {Objective—Children with hearing loss who use cochlear implants have lower quality of life (QoL) in social situations and lower self-esteem than hearing peers. The child's QoL has been assessed primarily by asking the parent rather than asking the child. This poses a problem because parents have difficulty judging less observable aspects like self-esteem and socio-emotional functioning, the domains most affected by hearing loss. Methods—This case-control study evaluated QoL in 50 preschoolers using a cochlear implant and their parents with the Kiddy KINDLR, an established QoL measure. Children's responses were compared to a hearing control group and correlated with demographic variables. We used a questionnaire for parents and a face-to-face interview with children. T-tests were used to compare (a) paired parent-child ratings and (b) children with cochlear implants versus normal hearing. Spearman rank correlations were used to compare QoL with demographic variables. Results—Children using cochlear implants rated overall QoL significantly more positively than their parents (MD = 4.22, p=.03). Child rating of QoL did not differ significantly by auditory status (cochlear implant (82.8) vs. hearing (80.8), p=0.42). Overall QoL correlated inversely with cochlear implant experience and chronologic age, but did not correlate with implantation age. Conclusions—Preschool children using cochlear implants can assess adequately their own QoL, but parents afford valuable complementary perspective on the child's socio-emotional and physical well-being. Preschool children using cochlear implants rate overall QoL measures similar to hearing peers. A constellation of QoL measures should be collected to yield a better understanding of general QoL as well as specific domains centered on hearing loss.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the mean daily cost of intensive care, identify key factors associated with increased cost, and determine the incremental cost of mechanical ventilation during a day in the intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis using data from NDCHealth's Hospital Patient Level Database. SETTING: A total of 253 geographically diverse U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: The study included 51,009 patients {\textgreater}/=18 yrs of age admitted to an intensive care unit between October 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Days of intensive care and mechanical ventilation were identified using billing data, and daily costs were calculated as the sum of daily charges multiplied by hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios. Cost data are presented as mean (+/-sd). Incremental daily cost of mechanical ventilation was calculated using log-linear regression, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. Approximately 36{\%} of identified patients were mechanically ventilated at some point during their intensive care unit stay. Mechanically ventilated patients were older (63.5 yrs vs. 61.7 yrs, p {\textless} .0001) and more likely to be male (56.1{\%} vs. 51.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.0001), compared with patients who were not mechanically ventilated, and required mechanical ventilation for a mean duration of 5.6 days +/- 9.6. Mean intensive care unit cost and length of stay were 31,574 +/- 42,570 dollars and 14.4 days +/- 15.8 for patients requiring mechanical ventilation and 12,931 +/- 20,569 dollars and 8.5 days +/- 10.5 for those not requiring mechanical ventilation. Daily costs were greatest on intensive care unit day 1 (mechanical ventilation, 10,794 dollars; no mechanical ventilation, 6,667 dollars), decreased on day 2 (mechanical ventilation:, 4,796 dollars; no mechanical ventilation, 3,496 dollars), and became stable after day 3 (mechanical ventilation, 3,968 dollars; no mechanical ventilation, 3,184 dollars). Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, the mean incremental cost of mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit patients was 1,522 dollars per day (p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care unit costs are highest during the first 2 days of admission, stabilizing at a lower level thereafter. Mechanical ventilation is associated with significantly higher daily costs for patients receiving treatment in the intensive care unit throughout their entire intensive care unit stay. Interventions that result in reduced intensive care unit length of stay and/or duration of mechanical ventilation could lead to substantial reductions in total inpatient cost.},
