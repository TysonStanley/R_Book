Barrett 2016-10-05 Preface “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” — Isaac Newton, circa 1676 Science. It is built on replication and construction. Once an idea is established and well replicated, the next steps are to build on to it. This is a major aspect of science. We try to build from a foundation established by others. It should also be how we analyze our data, not only in methodology but also in software. Lucky for us, R is how we do just that. This book is for beginners in R; especially those in health, behavioral and social sciences. R is unique. It is an open source project and improvements—known as packages—are being made by smart individuals across the globe. I’ll introduce you to many ways in which R can be used in your work. You’ll find that it can help in all facets of your data analysis and communication. In the long run, taking some time to learn a knew tool will save you time, energy, and probably most importantly, frustration. It will also increase the replicability of your analyses. We will quickly, and succinctly, introduce the newest, easiest, and most understandable ways of working with your data. Part I Chapter 1: Introduces the basics of the language Chapter 2: Manipulate Your Data (reshape, subset, join) Chapter 3: Understanding your data (summary statistics, ggplot2) Part II Chapter 4: Basic Analyses (ANOVA, Linear Regression) Chapter 5: Generalized Linear Models Chapter 6: Mulilevel Modeling Chapter 7: Other Modeling Techniques Part III Chapter 8: Advanced data manipulation Chapter 9: Advanced plotting Chapter 10: Where to go from here At the end of the book, you should be able to: 1) use R to perform your data manipulation and data analyses, 2) understand online helps (e.g. www.stackoverflow.com, www.r-bloggers.com). Download R and RStudio To begin, you will need to download the R software www.r-project.org and then the RStudio software www.rstudio.com. R is the brains and RStudio1 is an IDE (something that helps us work with R much more easily). Once both are installed (helps on installing the software can be found on www.rstudio.com, www.r-bloggers.com, and www.statmethods.net) you are good to go. The remainder of the book will be about actually using it. Enjoy!2 Get the free version of Rstudio. Believe me, it doesn’t feel like it should be free software.↩ Note that to return to the blog, you can click here↩ "]
